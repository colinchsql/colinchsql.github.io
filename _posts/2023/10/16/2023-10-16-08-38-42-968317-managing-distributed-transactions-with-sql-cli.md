In today's distributed and microservice-based applications, it is not uncommon to encounter scenarios where transactions span multiple databases or services. Managing distributed transactions in such environments can be challenging. However, SQL CLI (Command Line Interface) provides a convenient and efficient way to handle distributed transactions.

## What is SQL CLI?

SQL CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with databases using SQL queries and commands. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to execute SQL statements and manage database transactions from the command line.

## Why use SQL CLI for distributed transactions?

Using SQL CLI for managing distributed transactions offers several benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: SQL CLI provides a familiar and straightforward way to execute SQL statements, making it easy to work with distributed transactions.

2. **Efficiency**: SQL CLI allows you to automate transaction management by scripting SQL queries and commands. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures consistent and efficient transaction handling.

3. **Flexibility**: SQL CLI supports various databases, making it suitable for managing transactions across different database systems within a distributed environment.

## Examples of managing distributed transactions with SQL CLI

Let's consider an example where we have two databases, `Database A` and `Database B`, and we need to perform a transaction that involves updating data in both databases.

To manage this distributed transaction using SQL CLI, we can follow these steps:

1. Connect to `Database A` using SQL CLI:
   
   ```sql
   mysql -u username -p -h hostA -P portA databaseA
   ```

2. Start a transaction in `Database A`:
   
   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   ```

3. Perform the necessary updates in `Database A`:
   
   ```sql
   UPDATE tableA SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
   ```

4. Connect to `Database B` using SQL CLI:
   
   ```sql
   mysql -u username -p -h hostB -P portB databaseB
   ```

5. Start a transaction in `Database B`:
   
   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   ```

6. Perform the necessary updates in `Database B`:
   
   ```sql
   UPDATE tableB SET column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
   ```

7. If everything is successful, commit the transaction in both databases:
   
   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```

8. If any errors occur, rollback the transaction in both databases:
   
   ```sql
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

By following these steps, we can ensure that the distributed transaction is managed consistently and effectively using SQL CLI.

## Conclusion

Managing distributed transactions is a critical aspect of distributed applications. SQL CLI provides a simple and efficient way to handle distributed transactions by scripting SQL queries and commands. With its flexibility and compatibility with various databases, SQL CLI is a valuable tool for managing distributed transactions in any distributed environment.
