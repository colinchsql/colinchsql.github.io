The command-line interface (CLI) for SQL provides a convenient way to interact with relational databases. By default, the SQL CLI prompt may be simplistic and not very informative. However, you can customize the prompt to display useful information and make it more aesthetically pleasing. In this blog post, we will explore how to customize the SQL CLI prompt to suit your needs.

## Changing the Prompt Text
The first step in customizing the SQL CLI prompt is to change the prompt text. By default, the prompt may simply display `>`. However, you can modify it to show more relevant information. For example, you can include the name of the database you are connected to or the username.

To change the prompt text, you need to update the SQL CLI configuration file. The location of this file may vary based on the database management system you are using. In general, you can find it in the home directory or in a `.sql` directory.

Once you locate the configuration file, open it in a text editor. Look for the section that defines the prompt text. It may be denoted by a variable like `PS1` or `PROMPT`. Edit the value of this variable to specify the desired prompt text. Save the changes and restart the SQL CLI for the new prompt text to take effect.

## Displaying Connection Information
In addition to changing the prompt text, you may also want to display information about the currently active database connection. This can be useful when working with multiple databases or when sharing your CLI session with others.

To display connection information, you can include placeholders in the prompt text that will be replaced with the relevant details. For example, you can use the `{database}` placeholder to display the name of the current database.

Again, you need to update the SQL CLI configuration file and modify the prompt text to include the desired placeholders. Save the changes and restart the SQL CLI for the updated prompt to appear.

## Adding Timestamp
Another useful customization option is to add a timestamp to the SQL CLI prompt. This can help you track the time when each command was executed and make it easier to review your session history.

To add a timestamp to the prompt, you can include the `{time}` placeholder in the prompt text. This placeholder will be replaced with the current timestamp whenever a new command is entered.

Once again, edit the SQL CLI configuration file and add the `{time}` placeholder to the prompt text. Save the changes and restart the CLI for the timestamp to be displayed.

## Conclusion
Customizing the SQL CLI prompt can greatly enhance your experience and productivity when working with relational databases. By changing the prompt text, displaying connection information, and adding a timestamp, you can make the CLI more informative and tailored to your needs. Experiment with different configurations to find the setup that works best for you.

Don't forget to check the documentation for your specific SQL CLI for more details on customizing the prompt.
