In this blog post, we will discuss how to create stored procedures in the SQL Command Line Interface (CLI). Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit of work. They are useful for encapsulating complex logic and improving performance.

## What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a named group of SQL statements that can be executed multiple times without the need to write the entire SQL query each time. It is stored in the database and can be called and executed by various applications or scripts.

## Creating Stored Procedures in SQL CLI
To create a stored procedure in SQL CLI, you can use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement followed by the procedure name and the SQL statements enclosed within a BEGIN and END block. Here's an example of creating a simple stored procedure that inserts a new record into a table:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertUser 
    @username VARCHAR(50),
    @email VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Users (Username, Email)
    VALUES (@username, @email)
END
```

In the above example, we create a stored procedure named `InsertUser` that accepts two parameters: `@username` and `@email`. The stored procedure then inserts the provided values into the `Users` table.

## Executing Stored Procedures
Once you have created a stored procedure, you can execute it using the `EXEC` statement followed by the procedure name and the parameter values. Here's how you can execute the `InsertUser` stored procedure:

```sql
EXEC InsertUser 'johnsmith', 'john@example.com'
```

The above code will execute the `InsertUser` stored procedure with the provided username and email values.

## Benefits of Using Stored Procedures
There are several benefits to using stored procedures in SQL CLI:

1. **Code Reusability**: Stored procedures can be reused by multiple applications or scripts, reducing code duplication.
2. **Improved Performance**: Executing stored procedures can be faster than executing individual SQL queries, as they are pre-compiled and optimized by the database engine.
3. **Enhanced Security**: By using stored procedures, you can grant permissions to execute the procedure while restricting direct access to the underlying tables.

## Conclusion
Stored procedures are a powerful tool in SQL CLI for encapsulating complex logic and improving performance. They provide code reusability, improved performance, and enhanced security. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can create and execute stored procedures in SQL CLI effectively.
