If you're working with a relational database, the SQL Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for interacting with your database. SQL CLI allows you to execute queries and retrieve data from your database right from the command line. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of querying data using SQL CLI.

## Connecting to the Database
To start querying data using SQL CLI, you first need to connect to your database. The specific command to connect to your database may vary depending on the database system you are using. Here's an example of how to connect to a SQLite database:

```shell
sqlite3 path/to/database.db
```

Replace `path/to/database.db` with the path to your database file. Once connected, you'll see a prompt where you can execute your SQL queries.

## Executing Basic Queries
To execute a query in SQL CLI, simply write the SQL statement and press Enter. For example, to retrieve all records from a table named `users`, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Make sure to end your query with a semicolon `;`.

## Retrieving Data
To retrieve specific columns from a table, you can modify the `SELECT` statement by specifying the column names. For example, to retrieve only the `name` and `email` columns from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users;
```

This will return only the specified columns for each record.

## Filtering Data
To filter your query results based on specific conditions, you can use the `WHERE` clause. For example, to retrieve all users with the name "John":

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John';
```

You can use operators like `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to compare values in your conditions.

## Sorting Data
To sort the query results in a specific order, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause. For example, to retrieve all users sorted by their `name` in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
```

You can use `ASC` for ascending order and `DESC` for descending order.

## Limiting Results
Sometimes you may want to retrieve only a specific number of results. You can use the `LIMIT` clause to achieve this. For example, to retrieve the first 10 users from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

This will limit the query results to the specified number.

## Conclusion
SQL CLI provides a convenient way to query and retrieve data from your database using SQL commands right from the command line. In this blog post, we covered the basics of querying data in SQL CLI, including connecting to the database, executing queries, retrieving data, filtering and sorting results, and limiting the number of results. With these techniques, you can efficiently interact with your database and access the information you need.
