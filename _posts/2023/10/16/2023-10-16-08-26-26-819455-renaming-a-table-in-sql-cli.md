## Prerequisites
Before renaming a table, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Access to the SQL CLI for your database system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Sufficient privileges to execute SQL commands.

## Renaming a Table
To rename a table using SQL CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open your SQL CLI by running the respective command for your database system.

2. Connect to your database by entering the necessary connection details, such as hostname, username, and password.

3. Once connected, use the `RENAME TABLE` statement to rename the table. The syntax may vary slightly depending on the database system you are using. Here's the general syntax:

   ```sql
   RENAME TABLE current_table_name TO new_table_name;
   ```

   Replace `current_table_name` with the name of the table you want to rename and `new_table_name` with the desired new name for the table.

   For example, to rename a table named `employees` to `staff`, you would run the following command:

   ```sql
   RENAME TABLE employees TO staff;
   ```

4. After executing the command, the table will be renamed. You can verify the change by listing the tables in the database or running queries that reference the renamed table.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have covered the process of renaming a table using SQL CLI. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily rename tables in your database system. Remember to exercise caution when renaming tables and ensure that any dependent objects or queries are updated accordingly.
