When working with the SQL Command Line Interface (CLI), you may often find the need to import query results from a file. This can be useful for various reasons, such as sharing or analyzing the data in a different format. In this blog post, we'll explore how to import query results from a file in SQL CLI.

## Exporting query results to a file

Before importing query results from a file, you first need to export the results into the desired file format. This can be done using the SQL CLI's built-in functions or commands specific to your database management system.

For example, in MySQL, you can use the `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` statement to export query results to a file. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/output/file.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
FROM table_name;
```

In the above example, the query results will be exported to a file named `file.csv` located at the specified path.

Make sure to adjust the file path and desired file format according to your requirements and the capabilities of your database management system.

## Importing query results from a file

Once you have exported the query results to a file, you can easily import them back into SQL CLI. This can be done using the `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement, which allows you to load data from a file into a table.

Here's an example of how to import query results from a CSV file in MySQL:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/input/file.csv'
INTO TABLE table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
(column1, column2);
```

In the above example, the data from the file `file.csv` will be loaded into the specified table, with the columns `column1` and `column2` mapping to the corresponding fields in the file.

Again, make sure to adjust the file path, table name, and column mappings according to your specific setup.

## Conclusion

Importing query results from a file in SQL CLI is a handy feature that can save you time and effort when working with data. By using the appropriate export and import commands or statements, you can easily transfer data from one format to another. So next time you need to import query results from a file, give these techniques a try!
