SQL CLI, also known as sql-cli, is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with SQL databases using a simple and intuitive interface. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to install SQL CLI on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before installing SQL CLI, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your system
- An SQL database server configured and running

## Installation Steps

To install SQL CLI, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Install SQL CLI globally using the npm package manager by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g sql-cli
   ```

3. Wait for the installation to complete. Once finished, you will have SQL CLI installed on your system.

## Connecting to an SQL Database

Once SQL CLI is installed, you can connect to an SQL database using the following command:
