When working with different database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or others, it's important to have a consistent and efficient method of accessing and manipulating data. One popular way to interact with DBMS is through the command-line interface (CLI). In this article, we will explore how to use the SQL CLI with different DBMS.

## MySQL CLI
MySQL provides a command-line client tool called `mysql` to interact with its database. To start the MySQL CLI, open your terminal and enter the following command:

```sql
mysql -u <username> -p
```

Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username. You will be prompted to enter your MySQL password. Once authenticated, you can start executing SQL queries directly from the CLI.

## PostgreSQL CLI
Similar to MySQL, PostgreSQL also offers a command-line client tool called `psql` for interacting with its database. To open the PostgreSQL CLI, open your terminal and enter the following command:

```sql
psql -U <username> -d <database>
```

Replace `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username and `<database>` with the name of the database you want to connect to. Enter your password when prompted, and you will be ready to issue SQL commands.

## Oracle CLI
Oracle Database provides a command-line interface called SQL*Plus. To run SQL*Plus, open your terminal and type the following command:

```sql
sqlplus <username>/<password>@<database>
```

Replace `<username>` with your Oracle username, `<password>` with your password, and `<database>` with the database name you want to connect to. Once connected, you can start executing SQL statements.

## Other DBMS CLI
Different DBMS have their own specific CLI tools. Some other popular ones include Microsoft SQL Server's `sqlcmd` CLI and SQLite's `sqlite3` CLI. Refer to the respective documentation for the specific CLI commands and options for these DBMS.

## Conclusion
Using the CLI to interact with different DBMS can provide a quick and powerful way to manage your databases. Whether you are working with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or other DBMS, the command-line interface allows you to execute SQL commands efficiently. By becoming familiar with the CLI tools for these DBMS, you can work seamlessly across different database environments.
