In this blog post, we will explore how to execute user-defined functions (UDFs) in SQL Command Line Interface (CLI). UDFs are custom functions created by users to perform specific operations that are not available in the built-in SQL functions.

## What are User-Defined Functions (UDFs)?

User-Defined Functions (UDFs) are functions that are created by users to extend the functionality of the SQL language. Unlike built-in SQL functions, UDFs can be customized to perform specific operations based on user requirements.

## Creating a User-Defined Function

To create a UDF, you need to use the appropriate syntax for your database system. Here's an example of creating a simple UDF in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION hello_world()
RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
BEGIN
    RETURN 'Hello, World!';
END;
```

In the above example, we define a UDF named `hello_world()` that returns a `VARCHAR` value. The function simply returns the string 'Hello, World!'.

## Executing a UDF in SQL CLI

Once you have created a UDF, you can execute it in SQL CLI by calling the function name. Here's an example of executing the `hello_world()` UDF in MySQL:

```sql
SELECT hello_world();
```

The SQL statement `SELECT hello_world();` would return 'Hello, World!' as the result.

Similarly, you can execute UDFs in other database systems such as Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc. The syntax for executing UDFs may vary depending on the database system you are using.

## Conclusion

User-Defined Functions (UDFs) provide a way to extend the functionality of SQL by allowing users to create custom functions. These functions can then be executed in SQL CLI or other SQL interfaces. By leveraging UDFs, users can perform complex operations and calculations that are not possible with built-in SQL functions.

By understanding how to create and execute UDFs in SQL CLI, you can harness the full power of SQL and tailor it to meet your specific needs.
