When working with large datasets in the SQL command line interface (CLI), it can be quite cumbersome to view all the results at once. To make it easier to navigate through the results, pagination can be used. Pagination allows you to divide the query results into smaller, more manageable chunks, making it easier to browse through the data.

In this blog post, we will explore how to display query results with pagination in the SQL CLI.

## 1. Limiting the number of rows returned

The first step in implementing pagination is to limit the number of rows returned by the query. By using the `LIMIT` clause, you can specify the maximum number of rows to be displayed at a time. For example, to display 10 rows at a time, you can modify your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10;
```

This query will retrieve only 10 rows from the `table_name` table.

## 2. Adding an offset

Now that we have limited the number of rows returned, we need to add an offset to retrieve the next set of rows. The offset specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to retrieve the data. By combining the offset with the limit clause, we can easily navigate through the dataset. For example, to retrieve rows 11 to 20, you can modify your query as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

This query will skip the first 10 rows and retrieve the next 10 rows.

## 3. Using variables for pagination

To make pagination more dynamic, you can use variables to store the limit and offset values. This allows you to easily change the number of rows displayed or navigate through the dataset without modifying the query itself. Here's an example of using variables for pagination:

```sql
DECLARE @limit INT;
DECLARE @offset INT;

SET @limit = 10;
SET @offset = 10;

SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT @limit OFFSET @offset;
```

By modifying the values of `@limit` and `@offset`, you can control the pagination behavior.

## Conclusion

By implementing pagination in the SQL CLI, you can efficiently navigate through large datasets and view query results in a more manageable way. Limiting the number of rows returned and adding an offset allow for easy retrieval of data in smaller chunks. Using variables for pagination provides flexibility and allows for dynamic changes to the pagination behavior.

Implementing pagination in the SQL CLI can greatly improve your workflow when working with large datasets, making it easier to browse and analyze the data.

Keep in mind that the syntax for pagination may vary depending on the SQL database you are using. Always consult the documentation or specific resources for your database to ensure accurate implementation.
