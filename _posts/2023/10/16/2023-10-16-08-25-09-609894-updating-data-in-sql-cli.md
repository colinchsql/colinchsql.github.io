When working with a SQL Command Line Interface (CLI), you often need to update data in your database tables. Whether you need to modify existing records or add new ones, the SQL CLI provides a straightforward approach to make these changes. In this blog post, we will explore some common methods to update data using the SQL CLI.

- [Updating Multiple Records](#updating-multiple-records)
- [Modifying a Specific Field](#modifying-a-specific-field)
- [Adding New Records](#adding-new-records)

## Updating Single Records

To update a single record in your SQL database using the CLI, you can make use of the `UPDATE` statement. This statement allows you to modify one or more fields of a specific record based on certain conditions.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of your table and `column1`, `column2` with the respective column names you want to update. Set the new values for the columns using `value1`, `value2`. The `WHERE` clause specifies the condition to identify the record you want to update.

For example, to update the `price` of a product with the `product_id` 10 in a table called `products`, you can use the following query:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 29.99
WHERE product_id = 10;
```

## Updating Multiple Records

When you need to update multiple records at once, you can still use the `UPDATE` statement. The only difference is that you don't need to specify a particular condition to update all the targeted records.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2;
```

For instance, let's say you want to update the `status` field of all products in a table called `products` to "Out of Stock". The query would look like this:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET status = 'Out of Stock';
```

## Modifying a Specific Field

If you only want to modify a specific field without altering other existing values, you can utilize the `UPDATE` statement alongside the `WHERE` clause to identify the record you want to update.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column = new_value
WHERE condition;
```

For example, let's say you want to increment the `quantity` field of a product by 1 where the `product_id` is 5. The query would be:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET quantity = quantity + 1
WHERE product_id = 5;
```

## Adding New Records

To add new records to your SQL database table using the CLI, you can use the `INSERT INTO` statement. It allows you to specify the table name and provide the values for each column.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of your table and `column1`, `column2` with the respective column names. Set the values for the columns using `value1`, `value2`.

For example, let's say you want to add a new product to a table called `products` with a `product_name` of "iPhone 12" and a `price` of 999.99. The query would be:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price)
VALUES ('iPhone 12', 999.99);
```

Remember to enclose string values in single quotes ('').

Updating data in SQL CLI is a fundamental skill for database management. With the `UPDATE` and `INSERT INTO` statements, you can easily modify existing records and add new ones to meet your requirements. Make sure to double-check your queries before executing them to avoid unintended changes in your database.
