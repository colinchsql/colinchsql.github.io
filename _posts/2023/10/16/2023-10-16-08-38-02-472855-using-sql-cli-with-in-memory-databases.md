## Introduction
In-memory databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their fast performance and ability to handle large datasets. One popular way to interact with in-memory databases is through a SQL Command Line Interface (CLI). In this article, we will explore how to use SQL CLI with in-memory databases.

## What is SQL CLI?
SQL CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows users to interact with databases using SQL commands directly from the command line. It provides a command-line interface for executing SQL statements and managing database connections.

## Setting up an In-Memory Database
Before using SQL CLI with an in-memory database, you'll need to set up the database. There are several in-memory databases available, such as SQLite and H2 Database. Choose the one that suits your requirements and install it on your machine.

## Connecting to the In-Memory Database
Once the in-memory database is set up, you can connect to it using SQL CLI. Open your command line interface and type the command to start the SQL CLI tool, specifying the necessary parameters like database type, hostname, port, username, and password.

```
sqlcli --database=IN_MEMORY --hostname=localhost --port=8080 --username=admin --password=secret
```

Replace the values in the command with the appropriate details for your specific in-memory database setup.

## Executing SQL Commands
After connecting to the in-memory database, you can start executing SQL commands. SQL CLI provides a command prompt where you can type and execute SQL statements.

For example, to create a table in the in-memory database, you can use the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
```

To insert data into the table, you can use the INSERT statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith');
```

You can execute SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements in a similar manner.

## Querying Data and Viewing Results
To query data from the in-memory database, you can use SELECT statements. For example, to retrieve all records from the users table, you can use the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

SQL CLI will display the results of the query in a tabular format right in the command line interface.

## Conclusion
Using SQL CLI with in-memory databases provides a convenient way to interact with and manage data. It allows you to execute SQL commands directly from the command line, making it easier to work with in-memory databases. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can start using SQL CLI with your in-memory database and perform various operations efficiently.
