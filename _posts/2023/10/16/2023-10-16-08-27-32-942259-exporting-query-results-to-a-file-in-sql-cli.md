## Introduction

SQL CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the database using command-line instructions. It provides a convenient way to execute queries and perform other database operations. One common requirement is to export query results to a file, which can be easily achieved using the SQL CLI.

## Exporting Query Results to a File

To export query results to a file in SQL CLI, you can use the `spool` command. The `spool` command allows you to redirect the output of your queries to a file.

The basic syntax for exporting query results to a file is as follows:

```sql
spool <file_path>
<your_query>
spool off
```

In the above syntax:
- `<file_path>` is the path and name of the file where you want to save the query results.
- `<your_query>` is the SQL query that you want to execute and export the results.

After executing the above commands, the query results will be saved to the specified file.

## Example

Let's say you have a table called `employees` in your database, and you want to export the names and salaries of all employees to a file called `employee_salaries.txt`. You can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Open the SQL CLI.
2. Execute the following commands:

```sql
spool employee_salaries.txt
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
spool off
```

3. After executing the above commands, a file named `employee_salaries.txt` will be created in the current directory with the query results.

## Conclusion

Exporting query results to a file in SQL CLI is a simple and powerful feature that allows you to save and share data easily. By following the `spool` command syntax, you can redirect the output of your queries to a file of your choice. This can be helpful for generating reports, analyzing data, or sharing information with others.

Remember to make good use of this feature and explore other capabilities of SQL CLI to optimize your database operations.
