In many scenarios, we may need to generate and execute SQL statements dynamically in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Dynamic SQL allows us to build SQL statements at runtime based on specific conditions or user input, providing flexibility and enabling more dynamic interaction with the database.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create and execute dynamic SQL statements in the CLI using a sample programming language.

## Introduction
The CLI provides a convenient interface to interact with databases through the command line. While static SQL statements are predefined and fixed, dynamic SQL allows us to generate SQL statements on the fly based on certain conditions or requirements. This capability is particularly useful when dealing with user input or dynamically changing conditions.

## Using Dynamic SQL in CLI
To create and execute dynamic SQL statements in the CLI, we generally follow these steps:

1. Capture user input or specify the conditions dynamically.
2. Build the SQL statement using a combination of static text and variables.
3. Execute the SQL statement using the appropriate CLI command.
4. Process the results, if any.

It's important to handle user input carefully to prevent potential SQL injection attacks. Ensure that any user-supplied values are properly sanitized or parameterized before including them in the SQL statement.

## Example Code
Let's see a simple example of how to create and execute dynamic SQL statements in the CLI using Python.

```python
import sqlite3

# User input or dynamic conditions
table_name = input("Enter the name of the table: ")
column_name = input("Enter the name of the column: ")

# Building the dynamic SQL statement
sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE {column_name} = ?"

# Establishing a database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Executing the dynamic SQL statement
cursor.execute(sql_query, ("some_value",))  # Placeholder for user-supplied value

# Fetching and processing the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Closing the database connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

In the above example, the user is prompted to enter the name of a table and a column. The input values are then used to build a SELECT statement dynamically. The `?` placeholder is used for parameterization, which helps prevent SQL injection.

Once the dynamic SQL statement is executed, the results are fetched and processed accordingly.

## Conclusion
Dynamic SQL statements are a powerful tool for interacting with databases in the CLI. They allow us to build SQL queries on the fly based on specific conditions or user input, providing flexibility and enhancing the user experience.

Remember to handle user input carefully, sanitize or parameterize values, and prevent potential SQL injection attacks.
