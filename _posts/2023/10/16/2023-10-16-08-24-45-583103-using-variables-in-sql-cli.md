The SQL command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for working with databases directly from the command line. One useful feature of the SQL CLI is the ability to use variables in your SQL statements, allowing you to dynamically input values or store intermediate results.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use variables in the SQL CLI. We will go through examples of declaring variables, assigning values to variables, and using variables in queries.

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in the SQL CLI, you can use the `DECLARE` statement followed by the variable name and its data type. For example, to declare a variable called `product_id` of type `INT`, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
DECLARE product_id INT;
```

You can declare multiple variables in a single `DECLARE` statement by separating them with commas. It's important to note that the SQL CLI uses the format `@variable_name` to reference variables.

## Assigning Values to Variables

Once you have declared a variable, you can assign a value to it using the `SET` statement. For example, to assign a value of 123 to the `product_id` variable, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SET @product_id = 123;
```

You can also assign the result of a query to a variable using the `SELECT` statement. For example, to assign the maximum price from a table called `products` to a variable called `max_price`, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT MAX(price) INTO @max_price FROM products;
```

## Using Variables in Queries

Variables can be used in SQL queries just like any other value. To use a variable in a query, simply reference it using the `@` symbol followed by the variable name. For example, to select all products with a specific `product_id`, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id;
```

Variables can also be used in expressions or calculations within queries. For example, to select all products with a price lower than the maximum price stored in the `max_price` variable, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < @max_price;
```

## Conclusion

Using variables in the SQL CLI can greatly enhance your productivity and flexibility when working with databases. Variables allow you to customize queries, store intermediary results, and make your SQL statements more dynamic. By understanding how to declare variables, assign values to them, and use them in queries, you can unlock the full potential of the SQL CLI.

We hope this blog post has provided you with a useful overview of using variables in the SQL CLI. Feel free to explore more advanced techniques and features of the SQL CLI to further enhance your database interactions.
