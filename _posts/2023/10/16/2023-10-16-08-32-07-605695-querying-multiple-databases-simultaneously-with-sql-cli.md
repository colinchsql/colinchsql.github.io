In today's tech world, it is common to work with multiple databases, each serving a different purpose or housing different datasets. However, managing and querying these databases individually can be time-consuming and inefficient. SQL Command Line Interface (CLI) tools provide a solution to this problem by allowing us to query multiple databases simultaneously.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use SQL CLI tools to connect and query multiple databases at once.

## Introduction to SQL CLI

SQL CLI tools are command-line interfaces that allow us to interact with databases using SQL language. These tools provide a convenient way to connect to databases, execute queries, and retrieve results directly from the command line.

Some popular SQL CLI tools include:

- MySQL CLI: The command-line interface for MySQL databases.
- PostgreSQL CLI: The command-line interface for PostgreSQL databases.
- SQLite CLI: The command-line interface for SQLite databases.

Depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using, you can choose the appropriate CLI tool for your needs.

## Connecting to multiple databases

Most SQL CLI tools provide an option to connect to multiple databases. This allows us to establish connections to several databases simultaneously, making it easier to query data from multiple sources in a single session.

The syntax for connecting to multiple databases varies depending on the CLI tool being used. However, the general approach involves specifying the database connection details, such as host, port, username, and password, for each database.

Here's an example of connecting to two databases using the MySQL CLI tool:

```mysql
mysql -h host1 -P port1 -u username1 -p password1 database1;
mysql -h host2 -P port2 -u username2 -p password2 database2;
```

By executing these commands, we establish connections to both `database1` and `database2`. Now, we can proceed to write queries that span across multiple databases.

## Writing queries across multiple databases

Once we have connected to multiple databases, we can write queries that access tables and data from different databases. This is particularly useful when we need to join or analyze data that resides in separate databases.

To write queries across multiple databases, we can fully qualify the table names by including the database name and a dot notation. For example, to join two tables from different databases:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM database1.table1
JOIN database2.table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

In this example, we specify the database name (`database1` and `database2`) as a prefix to the table name (`table1` and `table2`).

## Executing queries and getting results

Once we have written our query that spans multiple databases, we can execute it by simply entering the SQL command in the CLI tool prompt. The CLI tool will then send the query to the associated databases and retrieve the results.

The results of the query will be displayed in the CLI tool's output. Depending on the tool, the results can be displayed in various formats, such as a table, CSV, or JSON.

## Conclusion

Querying multiple databases simultaneously with SQL CLI tools provides a powerful way to work with data spread across different database systems. By leveraging the ability to connect to and query multiple databases at once, we can save time and effort when working with complex data scenarios.

In this blog post, we introduced SQL CLI tools, discussed how to connect to multiple databases, write queries that span across databases, and execute those queries to retrieve results.

To learn more about specific CLI tools, refer to their official documentation and resources. Happy querying!
