When it comes to managing SQL scripts and version control, most developers turn to tools like Git or SVN. However, these tools are not specifically designed for SQL scripts and may not provide the necessary features and functionalities.

In this blog post, we will explore an alternative approach to version control for SQL scripts using the command line interface (CLI) tools specifically built for SQL script management.

## Why Use Command Line Interface for SQL Script Version Control?

SQL scripts are an integral part of any database development process. They contain schema changes, stored procedures, triggers, and other database objects. Managing the versions of these scripts is crucial to ensure a smooth and reliable deployment process.

Using the command line interface for SQL script version control offers several benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: CLI tools provide a straightforward and easy-to-use interface for managing SQL scripts. You can work with familiar commands like `git` or `svn`, making the learning curve minimal for developers already familiar with version control.

2. **Efficiency**: CLI tools are known for their speed and efficiency. With large databases and complex schema changes, executing SQL scripts through CLI can be faster than using a GUI-based tool.

3. **Portability**: CLI tools can be used on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), making them an ideal choice for teams working with diverse development environments.

## CLI Tools for SQL Script Version Control

Below are two popular CLI tools specialized for version control of SQL scripts:

### 1. Flyway

Flyway is a database migration tool that allows developers to manage SQL scripts as version-controlled objects. It supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and more.

With Flyway, you can easily organize your SQL scripts into directories, name them using a specific naming convention (like `V1__create_table.sql`), and execute them in a specific order. Flyway keeps track of executed scripts and can handle rollbacks if needed.

To get started with Flyway, you can install it by downloading the CLI tool from their official website or by using a package manager like Homebrew.

### 2. Liquibase

Liquibase is another widely used CLI tool for database schema and data migration. It supports SQL scripts as well as XML or YAML-based changelog files. Liquibase provides extensive capabilities for managing database changes and tracking versions.

Similar to Flyway, Liquibase organizes SQL scripts into directories and executes them in a specific order defined by the changelog file. It supports popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and more.

To start using Liquibase, install it by downloading the CLI tool from their official website or by using a package manager like Homebrew.

## Conclusion

Version control is essential when dealing with SQL scripts, and using CLI-based tools specifically designed for SQL script management can greatly simplify the process. Tools like Flyway and Liquibase offer efficient and portable ways to manage SQL script versions, making them popular choices among developers.

By leveraging the power of CLI tools, you can ensure a streamlined and reliable deployment process for your database changes, ultimately leading to improved collaboration and productivity in your development team.
