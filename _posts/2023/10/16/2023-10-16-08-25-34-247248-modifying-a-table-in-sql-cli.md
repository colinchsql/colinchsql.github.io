In this blog post, we will explore the various ways to modify a table in the SQL Command Line Interface (CLI). We will cover renaming a table, adding or deleting columns, and modifying existing columns.

## Renaming a Table <a name="renaming-a-table"></a>
To rename a table in SQL CLI, we can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement along with the `RENAME TO` clause. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
```

Make sure to replace `old_table_name` with the current name of the table you want to rename, and `new_table_name` with the desired new name for the table.

## Adding or Deleting Columns <a name="adding-or-deleting-columns"></a>
To add or delete columns in a table, again we use the `ALTER TABLE` statement. To add a new column, we use the `ADD COLUMN` clause, and to delete a column, we use the `DROP COLUMN` clause. Here are some examples:

### Adding a Column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name column_datatype;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table where you want to add the column, `column_name` with the name of the new column, and `column_datatype` with the datatype for the new column.

### Deleting a Column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

In this case, replace `table_name` with the name of the table from which you want to delete the column, and `column_name` with the name of the column to be deleted.

## Modifying Existing Columns <a name="modifying-existing-columns"></a>
To modify an existing column in a table, we can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement along with the `ALTER COLUMN` clause. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET DATATYPE new_datatype;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table containing the column, `column_name` with the name of the column you want to modify, and `new_datatype` with the desired new datatype for the column.

## Conclusion
Modifying a table in SQL CLI can be done easily using the `ALTER TABLE` statement along with the appropriate clauses such as `RENAME TO`, `ADD COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN`, and `ALTER COLUMN`. This flexibility allows us to make changes to our database structure as per our requirements.
