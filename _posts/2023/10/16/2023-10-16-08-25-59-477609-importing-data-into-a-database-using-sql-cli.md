## Introduction

SQL CLI is a powerful tool that allows us to interact with a database using SQL commands directly from the command line. One of its useful features is the ability to import data into a database from various sources such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or other databases.

## Preparing the data

Before importing the data, it is important to ensure that the data is properly formatted and compatible with the target database schema. This may involve cleaning up any inconsistencies in the data, formatting it correctly, and ensuring that the data types match the target database columns.

## Using the SQL CLI

To import data into a database using SQL CLI, follow these steps:

1. Start by launching the SQL CLI and connecting to the target database using appropriate credentials.

	```
	sqlcli -u [username] -p [password] -d [database]
	```

2. Once connected, navigate to the location of the data file that you want to import.

	```
	cd /path/to/data
	```

3. Use the SQL `LOAD` or `COPY` command to import the data into the database. The specific command syntax may vary depending on the database system you are using. Here's an example of importing a CSV file:

	```sql
	LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.csv' INTO TABLE tablename
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
	LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	IGNORE 1 LINES;
	```

4. After executing the import command, the data will be inserted into the specified table in the database.

## Conclusion

Importing data into a database using SQL CLI is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily import data from various sources into your database. This capability is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to automate the data import process.

Give it a try and see how quickly you can import data using SQL CLI!
