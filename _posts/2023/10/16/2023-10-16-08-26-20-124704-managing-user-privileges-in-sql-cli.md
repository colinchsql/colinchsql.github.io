## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The SQL CLI provides powerful tools to manage user privileges, granting or revoking specific permissions to access database objects. By properly configuring user privileges, you can control who can perform various operations on your database.

## Granting Privileges<a name="granting-privileges"></a>

To grant privileges to a user, you can use the `GRANT` statement in SQL CLI. The syntax typically looks like this:

```sql
GRANT privileges ON object TO user;
```

For example, to grant `SELECT` and `INSERT` privileges on a table called `employees` to a user named `john`, you would execute the following command:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO john;
```

Make sure to replace `privileges`, `object`, and `user` with the appropriate values for your scenario.

## Revoking Privileges<a name="revoking-privileges"></a>

To revoke privileges from a user, you can use the `REVOKE` statement in SQL CLI. The syntax is similar to the `GRANT` statement:

```sql
REVOKE privileges ON object FROM user;
```

For example, to revoke the `UPDATE` privilege on a table called `orders` from a user named `mark`, you would use the following command:

```sql
REVOKE UPDATE ON orders FROM mark;
```

Again, replace `privileges`, `object`, and `user` with the relevant values for your specific case.

## Viewing User Privileges<a name="viewing-user-privileges"></a>

To view the privileges assigned to a particular user or a specific object, you can use the appropriate SQL statements.

To see the privileges granted to a user, execute the following query:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR user;
```

To check the privileges associated with a database object, such as a table or a view, run this command:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON object;
```

Replace `user` and `object` accordingly.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Properly managing user privileges is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your database. This blog post covered the basic commands to grant, revoke, and view user privileges using the SQL CLI. By mastering these commands, you can effectively control access to your database objects and ensure that only authorized users have the necessary permissions.

Remember to always review the SQL documentation for the specific database management system you are using to understand the full range of privilege management options available.
