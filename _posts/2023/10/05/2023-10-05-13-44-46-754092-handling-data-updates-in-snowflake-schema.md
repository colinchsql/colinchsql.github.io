When working with a Snowflake schema, which is a type of dimensional model commonly used in data warehousing, it is important to have a strategy in place for handling data updates. This is because Snowflake schemas tend to have a high level of data redundancy, which can make updates more complex compared to other database schemas.

In this blog post, we will explore some best practices and techniques for handling data updates in Snowflake schema.

## Understanding Snowflake Schema

Before we dive into data updates, let's first understand the basics of a Snowflake schema. A Snowflake schema organizes data into multiple tables in a hierarchical manner. It consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables, forming a star-like structure.

The dimension tables contain descriptive attributes about the data, while the fact table holds the numerical measures. This schema design helps improve query performance by separating the data into smaller, manageable tables that can be easily joined.

## Inserting New Data

When inserting new data into a Snowflake schema, the process is fairly straightforward. You can simply insert the new records into the relevant dimension and fact tables using standard SQL insert statements.

Since the Snowflake schema separates dimensions and facts, you don't need to worry about any impact on existing data. New data can be inserted without affecting the existing records.

## Updating Dimension Tables

Updating dimension tables in a Snowflake schema can be more complex compared to inserting new data. A dimension table may include attributes such as names, addresses, or other descriptive information that may change over time.

One common approach to handling updates in dimension tables is to use a slowly changing dimension (SCD) technique. There are different types of SCDs, but in the context of Snowflake schemas, the most commonly used technique is SCD Type 2.

SCD Type 2 maintains a history of changes by adding a new row for each update while preserving the old records. This allows you to track changes over time. The new rows are linked to the original records through a surrogate key, which helps maintain referential integrity.

To implement SCD Type 2 in Snowflake, you can use a combination of effective date and end date columns in the dimension table. When an update occurs, a new record is inserted with an updated effective date and the previous record's end date is set to the day before the update.

## Updating Fact Tables

In Snowflake schemas, updating fact tables can be more challenging due to their large size and the potential impact on associated dimension tables. Since facts contain numerical measures, it is not recommended to directly update the fact table.

Instead, a common approach is to implement a factless fact table with foreign keys to the relevant dimensions. This factless fact table captures events or transactions that occur, and any updates can be handled by adding new records rather than directly modifying existing ones.

Updating the factless fact table leverages the same SCD Type 2 technique mentioned earlier, allowing you to maintain a historical record of changes over time.

## Conclusion

Handling data updates in a Snowflake schema requires careful consideration of the schema design and the specific requirements of your data. By employing techniques like SCD Type 2 and factless fact tables, you can effectively manage updates while maintaining the integrity and performance of your data warehouse.

Remember that data updates in Snowflake schemas should be executed with caution, as they involve complex operations and may impact the overall performance of your data warehouse.
