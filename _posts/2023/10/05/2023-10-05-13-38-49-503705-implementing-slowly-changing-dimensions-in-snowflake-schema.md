In data warehousing, a slowly changing dimension (SCD) refers to a dimension in which the data changes over time, but at a slow pace. Examples of slowly changing attributes include customer addresses, product descriptions, or employee salaries. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema, a popular dimensional modeling technique used in data warehousing.

## What is a Snowflake Schema?

A Snowflake schema is a type of dimensional model used for structuring data in a data warehouse. It consists of a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables, forming a star shape. Each dimension table represents a specific attribute or characteristic of the data being analyzed.

## Types of Slowly Changing Dimensions

There are different types of slowly changing dimensions, depending on how the attribute values are updated over time. The commonly used types are:

1. **Type 1 (Overwrite):** In this type, the old attribute value is overwritten with the new value. No history is maintained.

2. **Type 2 (Add row):** In this type, a new row is added for every attribute value change. This allows historical analysis but increases the size of the dimension table.

3. **Type 3 (Add column):** In this type, additional columns are added to the dimension table to store the previous and current attribute values. It provides limited historical analysis.

## Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions in Snowflake Schema

To implement slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema, we can use the following steps:

**Step 1: Create Dimension Tables**

Create the dimension tables for each attribute that needs to track changes over time. For example, if we have a customer dimension with slowly changing addresses, we can create a `customer_dimension` table with columns like `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `address`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.

**Step 2: Update Dimension Tables**

When a change occurs in the slowly changing attribute (e.g., customer address), we need to update the relevant dimension table. For Type 2, a new row needs to be added with the updated attribute value and appropriate start and end dates. For Type 3, the relevant column containing the attribute value can be updated.

**Step 3: Joining Dimension Tables**

To analyze data using slowly changing dimensions, we need to join the fact table with the appropriate version of the dimension table based on the effective date. This allows us to retrieve historical attribute values and perform time-based analysis.

## Benefits and Considerations

Implementing slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema offers several benefits, such as:

- Historical trend analysis: It allows us to track changes in attribute values over time, enabling historical trend analysis.

- Simplified data management: By structuring the data into separate dimension tables, it becomes easier to manage and update specific attributes as needed.

However, there are also considerations to keep in mind when implementing slowly changing dimensions:

- Increased storage requirements: Type 2 slowly changing dimensions can significantly increase the size of the dimension table as new rows are added for each attribute value change.

- Query complexity: Joining the fact table with the dimension table based on the effective date adds complexity to queries, requiring careful design and optimization.

## Conclusion

Implementing slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema provides a structured approach to track and analyze changes in attribute values over time. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can effectively incorporate slowly changing dimensions into your data warehousing solution, enabling historical analysis and trend reporting.
