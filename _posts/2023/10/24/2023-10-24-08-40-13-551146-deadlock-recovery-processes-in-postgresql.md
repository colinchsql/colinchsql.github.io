Deadlocks are a common occurrence in multi-user database systems like PostgreSQL. A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions wait for each other to release resources, resulting in a circular dependency. To handle such situations, PostgreSQL implements deadlock detection and recovery processes.

## Deadlock Detection

PostgreSQL uses a wait-for graph to detect deadlocks. When a transaction requests a resource held by another transaction, it is added to the wait-for graph. If a cycle is detected in the graph, it indicates a deadlock. PostgreSQL identifies the transaction involved in the deadlock and aborts one or more transactions to break the deadlock.

## Deadlock Recovery

To recover from a deadlock, PostgreSQL needs to abort and rollback one of the transactions involved. PostgreSQL employs a **deadlock_timeout** parameter to control how long the system waits before triggering a deadlock recovery process.

The default value of **deadlock_timeout** is one second. If a deadlock is detected, PostgreSQL will wait for this timeout period to see if the deadlock resolves itself. If not, it initiates the deadlock recovery process.

During deadlock recovery, PostgreSQL examines the wait-for graph to determine which transaction(s) to abort. It chooses the victim transaction based on criteria such as transaction age, number of accessed pages, or deadlock history. The chosen transaction is then aborted, and its changes are rolled back.

PostgreSQL also provides a **pg_stat_activity** view that can be used to monitor the status of transactions and identify any potential deadlocks.

## Configuring Deadlock Recovery

The deadlock detection and recovery processes in PostgreSQL are enabled by default. However, you can customize the deadlock timeout by modifying the **deadlock_timeout** configuration parameter in the PostgreSQL configuration file or using the dynamic *SET* command.

To modify the **deadlock_timeout** parameter in the configuration file, locate the **postgresql.conf** file and add the following line:

```shell
deadlock_timeout = '5s'
```

This example sets the deadlock timeout to 5 seconds. After modifying the configuration file, you need to restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect.

You can also dynamically change the **deadlock_timeout** parameter using the *SET* command within a PostgreSQL session:

```sql
SET deadlock_timeout = '5s';
```

This will change the deadlock timeout for the current session only.

## Conclusion

Deadlocks can significantly impact the performance and availability of a database system. PostgreSQL's deadlock detection and recovery processes play a crucial role in handling and resolving deadlocks. By understanding how these processes work and configuring the deadlock timeout appropriately, you can effectively manage and recover from deadlock situations in PostgreSQL.
