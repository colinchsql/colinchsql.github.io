When working with databases, one common and potentially frustrating issue that can occur is a deadlock. A deadlock is a situation where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a standstill and preventing any progress.

In this article, we will explore how deadlock is handled in the read-committed isolation level, which is a commonly used isolation level in databases.

## Understanding Read-Committed Isolation Level

Read-committed isolation level ensures that each transaction only sees committed data. When a transaction reads data, it holds a shared lock on the data until the transaction is committed or rolled back. Other transactions can still read the same data but cannot modify it until the lock is released.

## Deadlock Detection

In the read-committed isolation level, the database management system (DBMS) automatically detects deadlocks when they occur. The DBMS keeps track of the transaction dependencies and waits-for graph to identify potential deadlocks.

## Deadlock Resolution

When a deadlock is detected, the DBMS selects a victim transaction to abort and release its resources. The victim transaction is typically the one that would cause the least disruption to the overall system. Once the victim transaction is aborted, the resources it held are released, allowing the other transactions to progress.

## Handling Deadlock Errors

When a transaction encounters a deadlock, the DBMS raises a deadlock error. In most programming languages and database frameworks, these errors can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms. Depending on the requirements of the application, the handling can involve retrying the transaction, delaying the transaction, or rolling back and restarting the transaction.

## Preventing Deadlocks

While the read-committed isolation level tackles deadlocks by detecting and resolving them, there are some best practices to follow in order to minimize the occurrence of deadlocks:

1. Keep transactions short and simple: Long-running transactions increase the chances of encountering deadlocks.
2. Acquire locks in a consistent order: To avoid circular dependencies, make sure that transactions always request locks in the same order.
3. Use appropriate indexing: Proper indexing can improve query performance and reduce the likelihood of deadlocks.

By following these best practices, you can minimize the occurrence of deadlocks and ensure smooth operation of your database applications.

## Conclusion

Handling deadlocks in a read-committed isolation level involves automatic detection by the DBMS and resolution by selecting a victim transaction to abort. Deadlock errors can be handled in application code using exception handling mechanisms. By following best practices and implementing strategies to prevent deadlocks, you can further enhance the reliability and performance of your database applications.
