When working with large datasets, it is often necessary to find the first occurrence of a specific value within the dataset. This can be particularly useful when dealing with product data, where you may want to identify the first time a particular product code appears in the dataset.

In SQL, you can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to achieve this. `FIRST_VALUE` is an analytical function that allows you to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of records.

Here is an example query that demonstrates how to use `FIRST_VALUE` to find the first occurrence of a product code in a dataset:

```sql
SELECT product_code, 
       FIRST_VALUE(product_name) OVER (PARTITION BY product_code ORDER BY date_added) AS first_product_name
FROM products;
```

In this example, we have a table called `products` with columns `product_code`, `product_name`, and `date_added`. We want to find the first occurrence of each product code and retrieve the corresponding product name.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is applied to the `product_name` column and it is ordered by the `date_added` column. By using the `PARTITION BY` clause, we can group the records by `product_code`, ensuring that the `FIRST_VALUE` function is applied within each group.

The result of this query will include the `product_code` and the corresponding `first_product_name` for each unique `product_code`.

By utilizing the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you can easily find the first occurrence of a product code in a dataset and retrieve the associated information. This can be especially helpful for analyzing product data and identifying trends or patterns in your dataset.

Keep in mind that the availability of the `FIRST_VALUE` function may vary depending on the SQL dialect or database system you are using. Please refer to your database documentation for more information.
