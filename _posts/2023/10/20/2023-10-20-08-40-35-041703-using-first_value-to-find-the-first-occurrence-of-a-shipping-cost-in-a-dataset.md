Data analysis often involves finding specific values within a dataset. One common scenario is finding the first occurrence of a specific value. In this article, we'll explore how to use the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL to find the first occurrence of a shipping cost in a dataset.

## What is FIRST_VALUE function?

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is a powerful analytical function in SQL that allows you to retrieve the first value in a group or partition according to a specified order. It is commonly used to find the earliest date, the first occurrence of a value, or the first record based on a specific criterion.

## Scenario

Let's consider a dataset containing shipping information for various orders. Each record includes the order ID, customer ID, shipping cost, and other relevant details. Our goal is to find the first occurrence of the shipping cost in the dataset.


## Example dataset

| Order ID | Customer ID | Shipping Cost | Order Date   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1        | 101         | 10.99         | 2021-01-01   |
| 2        | 102         | 5.99          | 2021-01-02   |
| 3        | 103         | 8.99          | 2021-01-03   |
| 4        | 104         | 10.99         | 2021-01-04   |
| 5        | 105         | 12.99         | 2021-01-05   |


## Using FIRST_VALUE to find the first occurrence of shipping cost

To find the first occurrence of the shipping cost in the dataset, we can utilize the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause. The `OVER` clause defines the window or partition over which the function is applied, and we'll order the data by the order date in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT 
  FIRST_VALUE(ShippingCost) OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS FirstShippingCost
FROM 
  Orders;
```

The above SQL query will return the first occurrence of the shipping cost in the dataset. In this case, the result would be 10.99, which is the shipping cost of the first order.

## Conclusion

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is a handy tool for finding the first occurrence of a specific value in a dataset. By leveraging the `FIRST_VALUE` function in conjunction with the `OVER` clause and appropriate ordering, we can easily retrieve the desired result. Whether you need to find the first shipping cost, earliest date, or any other first occurrence, `FIRST_VALUE` can be a valuable addition to your SQL toolkit.

Remember to calculate the first value based on a specified order to ensure accurate results.
