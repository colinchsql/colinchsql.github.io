When working with datasets that contain currency exchange rates, it is often necessary to find the first occurrence of a specific rate. The SQL window function `FIRST_VALUE` can be used to easily retrieve this information.

## What is FIRST_VALUE?

`FIRST_VALUE` is a window function in SQL that returns the value of a specified expression along with the corresponding row from the partition. It allows you to retrieve the first value within a group of rows defined by the `PARTITION BY` clause.

## Syntax of FIRST_VALUE

The syntax for using `FIRST_VALUE` is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC]
    [ROWS { UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | value PRECEDING } | RANGE { UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | value PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW | value FOLLOWING | UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING }]
)
```

- `expression`: The column or expression you want to retrieve the first value of.
- `PARTITION BY`: Optional clause that defines the groups of rows to consider.
- `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order in which rows are processed within each partition.
- `ASC | DESC`: Optional keyword to specify the sort order. By default, it is ascending.
- `ROWS` or `RANGE`: Optional clauses to further define the window frame within each partition.

## Example:

Let's say we have a table called `exchange_rates`, which contains the following columns: `date`, `currency`, and `rate`. We want to find the first occurrence of the exchange rate for a specific currency.

Here's an example of how to use `FIRST_VALUE` to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    currency,
    FIRST_VALUE(rate) OVER (
        PARTITION BY currency
        ORDER BY date ASC
    ) AS first_rate
FROM
    exchange_rates;
```

In this example, we are partitioning the data by `currency` and ordering it by `date` in ascending order. The `FIRST_VALUE` function then retrieves the first `rate` value within each partition.

## Conclusion

`FIRST_VALUE` is a powerful SQL function that allows you to easily retrieve the first occurrence of a specific column within a dataset. By using this function, you can efficiently find the initial value of currency exchange rates or any other metric in your data.
