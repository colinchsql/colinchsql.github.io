When working with time-series data, it is often necessary to find the first value after a specific date. This can be done using the SQL window function `FIRST_VALUE`.

`FIRST_VALUE` returns the first value in a set of rows, based on a given order, within a window frame. By specifying the appropriate ordering, we can easily retrieve the first value after a specific date.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how to use `FIRST_VALUE` for this task.

```sql
SELECT date, value,
    FIRST_VALUE(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS next_value
FROM your_table
WHERE date >= '2022-01-01'
ORDER BY date;
```
In this example, we assume that our table contains two columns: `date` and `value`. We want to find the first `value` that occurs after the date `'2022-01-01'`.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used with the `OVER` clause, which specifies the window frame. In this case, we want to include all rows from the current row (`CURRENT ROW`) to the end of the result set (`UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`).

The `ORDER BY` clause determines the order in which the rows are processed. In this example, we order the rows by `date` in ascending order.

The result of the query will include the `date`, the current `value`, and the `next_value` which represents the first value after the specified date.

Remember to adjust the table name and column names according to your specific database schema.

Using `FIRST_VALUE` in this way allows you to easily find the first value after a specific date in your time-series data. This can be particularly useful for various analytical and reporting purposes.

# Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to find the first value after a specific date in time-series data. By utilizing this SQL window function, you can easily retrieve the desired value and incorporate it into your data analysis. Keep exploring the capabilities of SQL window functions to enhance your data analysis workflows.
