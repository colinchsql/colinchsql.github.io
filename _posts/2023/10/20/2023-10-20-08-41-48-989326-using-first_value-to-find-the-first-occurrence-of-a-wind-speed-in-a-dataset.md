In SQL, there are various functions available that can help us in performing different operations on datasets. One such function is `FIRST_VALUE`, which allows us to retrieve the first occurrence of a particular value in a dataset based on a specified order.

Let's say we have a table called `WeatherData` which contains information about wind speed measurements at different times. The table has two columns: `MeasurementTime` (timestamp) and `WindSpeed` (decimal).

To find the first occurrence of a wind speed in the dataset, we can make use of the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `ORDER BY` clause. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT FIRST_VALUE(WindSpeed) OVER (ORDER BY MeasurementTime) AS FirstWindSpeed
FROM WeatherData;
```

In this query, we are using the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the first occurrence of `WindSpeed` based on the ascending order of `MeasurementTime`. The result will be a single row containing the first wind speed value found in the dataset.

It's important to note that the `FIRST_VALUE` function is available in most major SQL database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

By using this approach, we can easily find the first occurrence of a wind speed in a dataset. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as identifying the initial wind speed measurement or analyzing the behavior of wind speed over time.

Remember to adapt the table and column names in the example query according to your specific database schema.
