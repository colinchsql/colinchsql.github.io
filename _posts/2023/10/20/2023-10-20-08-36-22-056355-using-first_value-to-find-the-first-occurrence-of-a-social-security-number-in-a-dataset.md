In SQL, the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be useful when you need to find the first occurrence of a specific value in a dataset. This function returns the first value within a group of rows based on a specified ordering.

Let's say we have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

| employee_id | name     | ssn            |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 1           | John Doe | 123-45-6789    |
| 2           | Jane Doe | 987-65-4321    |
| 3           | Bob Smith| 555-55-5555    |
| 4           | Alice Lee | 111-11-1111    |
| 5           | Tom Brown | 987-65-4321    |

To find the first occurrence of a social security number (SSN) in this dataset, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function in combination with the `OVER` clause and the `PARTITION BY` clause. 

Here's an example query to find the first occurrence of each SSN in the `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ssn,
       FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER (PARTITION BY ssn ORDER BY employee_id) AS first_employee_name
FROM employees;
```

In this query, the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that we only get one row per unique SSN. The `FIRST_VALUE` function is applied over the `name` column, ordered by the `employee_id` column. The `PARTITION BY` clause tells the function to find the first value within each group of rows with the same SSN.

The result of this query will be:

| ssn            | first_employee_name |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 123-45-6789    | John Doe            |
| 987-65-4321    | Jane Doe            |
| 555-55-5555    | Bob Smith           |
| 111-11-1111    | Alice Lee           |

As you can see, the query successfully retrieves the first occurrence of each SSN along with the corresponding employee name.

Using the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be especially useful when dealing with datasets where you need to identify and analyze the first occurrence of specific values. It provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve this information from your dataset.

Remember to adapt the column names and table name to match your specific dataset.
