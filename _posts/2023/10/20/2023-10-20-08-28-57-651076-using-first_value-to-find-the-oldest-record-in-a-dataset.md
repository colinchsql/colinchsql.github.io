When working with datasets, there are often cases where you need to find the oldest record based on a specific criteria. One way to achieve this is by using the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function allows you to retrieve the value of a specified expression from the first row within a partition defined by an ORDER BY clause. This can be particularly useful when you want to find the oldest record based on a date or timestamp field.

Here's an example of how you can use `FIRST_VALUE` to find the oldest record in a dataset:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  date_created,
  FIRST_VALUE(date_created) OVER (ORDER BY date_created) AS oldest_record
FROM
  your_table;
```

In the above example, we are selecting the `id`, `name`, and `date_created` columns from the `your_table` table. The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the value of the `date_created` field from the first row in the dataset, ordered by `date_created`. The result is aliased as `oldest_record`.

Executing this query will give you a result set that includes the oldest record based on the `date_created` field.

You can further customize the query by adding additional conditions or modifying the ORDER BY clause to match your specific requirements. For example, you can change the sorting order to `DESC` if you want to find the newest record instead.

Using `FIRST_VALUE` provides a convenient way to find the oldest record in a dataset without the need for complex subqueries or multiple joins. It simplifies the query and improves its performance.

So, next time you need to find the oldest record in a dataset, give `FIRST_VALUE` a try! It can save you time and effort in writing more intricate SQL queries.
