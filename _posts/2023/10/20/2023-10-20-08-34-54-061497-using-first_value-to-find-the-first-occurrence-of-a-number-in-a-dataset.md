When working with datasets, it is common to need to find the first occurrence of a specific number or value. One way to achieve this is by using the `FIRST_VALUE` function, which is available in various SQL databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function allows you to retrieve the first value of an expression within a group of rows. To use this function for finding the first occurrence of a number in a dataset, you can follow these steps:

1. **Sorting the dataset**: Before using the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you need to ensure that the dataset is properly sorted based on the column you want to search for the first occurrence of the number. This can be done using the `ORDER BY` clause in your SQL query.

2. **Using the FIRST_VALUE function**: Once the dataset is sorted, you can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to fetch the first occurrence of the number. The function takes two arguments: the expression you want to retrieve the first value from and the `OVER` clause, which defines the partitioning and ordering of the rows in the dataset.

   Here's an example of how the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be used to find the first occurrence of a number in a dataset:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       column_name,
       FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS first_occurrence
   FROM 
       your_table
   WHERE 
       column_name = your_number;
   ```

   In this example, we are selecting the `column_name` and using the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the first occurrence of that number in the dataset. The result will be displayed in the `first_occurrence` column.

3. **Filtering the results**: Finally, you can add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on specific conditions. In the above example, the `WHERE` clause filters the dataset based on the `column_name` equal to `your_number`.

Using the `FIRST_VALUE` function provides a convenient way to find the first occurrence of a number in a dataset without the need for complex querying or multiple nested queries. This function can be a useful tool when analyzing datasets and performing calculations.

Make sure to consult the documentation of your specific SQL database for any variations or additional functionalities of the `FIRST_VALUE` function.
