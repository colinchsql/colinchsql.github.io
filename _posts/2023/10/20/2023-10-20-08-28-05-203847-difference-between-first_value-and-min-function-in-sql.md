When working with SQL queries, it's important to understand the difference between different functions to ensure accurate and efficient data retrieval. Two commonly used functions are `FIRST_VALUE` and `MIN`. While both functions are used to find the minimum value in a column, they have distinct differences and use cases.

## `MIN` Function

The `MIN` function in SQL is an aggregate function used to find the minimum value of a specified column within a group of rows. It returns the smallest value from the selected column.

Syntax:
```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

For example, consider a table `students` with columns `student_id` and `marks`. To find the lowest marks achieved by any student, we can use the `MIN` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT MIN(marks) FROM students;
```

The `MIN` function is useful when you want to find the overall minimum value in a column without considering any other factors.

## `FIRST_VALUE` Function

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of rows within a group. It allows you to get the value of a specified column from the first row returned by a query. 

Syntax:
```sql
SELECT FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY column_name) FROM table_name;
```

Consider the same `students` table. To find the lowest marks achieved by each student, along with their respective student IDs, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT student_id, FIRST_VALUE(marks) OVER (ORDER BY marks) FROM students;
```

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is particularly useful when you want to find the first value in an ordered set, rather than the overall minimum value.

## Key Differences

The key differences between `FIRST_VALUE` and `MIN` functions in SQL are as follows:

1. **Behavior**: The `MIN` function returns the minimum value from a column, while the `FIRST_VALUE` function retrieves the first value in an ordered set of rows.
2. **Usage**: `MIN` is used to find the overall minimum value in a column, whereas `FIRST_VALUE` is used to extract the first value in an ordered set.
3. **Functionality**: `FIRST_VALUE` can be used with the `OVER` clause to specify the ordering of rows, while `MIN` does not require any additional clause.
4. **Output**: `MIN` returns a single value, whereas `FIRST_VALUE` can return multiple values if used with appropriate grouping.

In summary, the `MIN` function is suitable for finding the overall minimum value in a column, while the `FIRST_VALUE` function is more relevant when you need to retrieve the first value within an ordered set of rows. Understanding these differences will help you choose the appropriate function for your specific SQL query requirements.
