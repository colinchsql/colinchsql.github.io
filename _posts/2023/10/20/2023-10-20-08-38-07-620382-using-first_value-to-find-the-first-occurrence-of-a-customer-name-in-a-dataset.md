When working with a dataset, you may encounter situations where you need to find the first occurrence of a particular value. In SQL, you can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to accomplish this task.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function returns the first value in an ordered set of results. Here's an example of how you can use `FIRST_VALUE` to find the first occurrence of a customer name in a dataset:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    customer_name,
    FIRST_VALUE(customer_name) OVER(ORDER BY order_date) AS first_customer_name
FROM 
    orders;
```

In this example, we have a table called `orders` that contains customer names and order dates. We want to find the first occurrence of each customer name based on the order date.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used with the `OVER` clause, which specifies the partitioning and ordering of the rows. In this case, we order the rows by `order_date`.

The result of the query will include the distinct customer names and the first occurrence of each name based on the order date.

By using the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you can easily find the first occurrence of a customer name in a dataset. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as identifying the first customer to place an order or tracking the earliest interaction with a particular customer.

Remember, the `FIRST_VALUE` function is available in most widely used relational database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

If you want to learn more about `FIRST_VALUE` and other window functions in SQL, you can refer to the documentation for your specific database system.
