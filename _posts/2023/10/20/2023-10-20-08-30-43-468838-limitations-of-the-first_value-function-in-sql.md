The `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL is a powerful tool for retrieving the first value in a sorted group of rows. It can be used in scenarios where you want to find the earliest or lowest value in a specific column within a group. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations to ensure accurate and efficient use of the function.

## 1. Sorting Constraints

The `FIRST_VALUE` function requires a specific ordering criteria to determine the first value. The data needs to be sorted either in ascending or descending order based on a particular column. If the data is not correctly sorted, the function may return unexpected results. 

If the ordering column is not unique, the `FIRST_VALUE` function will return the first encountered value based on the specified ordering. This could potentially lead to incorrect or inconsistent results if the dataset is not appropriately ordered.

## 2. Performance Considerations

Using the `FIRST_VALUE` function can have performance implications, especially when working with large datasets. The function requires sorting the data, which can be resource-intensive and impact query execution time. As the size of the dataset increases, the performance of queries using `FIRST_VALUE` may degrade significantly.

In scenarios where performance is crucial, it is beneficial to explore alternative options such as using indexes or employing other SQL techniques to optimize the query execution.

## 3. Window Function Dependency

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is a window function introduced in SQL:2003 and is not available in all database management systems. Therefore, its usage is dependent on the database engine being used. Before utilizing the `FIRST_VALUE` function, it is essential to check the compatibility of the database system with this function.

To overcome this limitation, alternative approaches like subqueries or self-joins can be used to achieve similar results in databases that do not support the `FIRST_VALUE` function.

## Conclusion

While the `FIRST_VALUE` function is a handy tool for retrieving the first value in a sorted group of rows, it is crucial to keep in mind its limitations. Sorting constraints, potential performance issues, and dependency on window functions are factors that must be considered while using the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL. By understanding these limitations, developers and database administrators can make informed decisions and ensure accurate and efficient use of this function.
