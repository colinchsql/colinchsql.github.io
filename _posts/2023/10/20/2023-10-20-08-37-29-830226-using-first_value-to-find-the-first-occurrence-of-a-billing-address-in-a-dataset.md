When working with datasets, it is often necessary to extract specific information based on certain conditions. One common scenario is finding the first occurrence of a billing address in a dataset. In SQL, you can achieve this using the `FIRST_VALUE` function. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use `FIRST_VALUE` to find the first billing address in a dataset.

Let's start with a sample table called `customers` that contains customer information, including their names, addresses, and billing addresses:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  address VARCHAR(100),
  billing_address VARCHAR(100)
);
```

To find the first billing address, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause. 

The syntax for `FIRST_VALUE` is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE (expression) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
  [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC] [NULLS {FIRST | LAST}] [, ...] ]
  [ROWS {n | ROW | BETWEEN start AND end}]
)
```

Here's an example query to find the first billing address:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  FIRST_VALUE(billing_address) OVER (
    ORDER BY id) AS first_billing_address
FROM 
  customers;
```
In the above query, we select the distinct `FIRST_VALUE` of the `billing_address` column over the ordered `id` column. This will give us the first billing address in the dataset.

You can also use the `PARTITION BY` clause within the `OVER` clause if you want to find the first billing address per specific groups or categories. For example, if you have customer types and want to find the first billing address for each type, you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  FIRST_VALUE(billing_address) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_type
    ORDER BY id) AS first_billing_address
FROM 
  customers;
```

By adding `PARTITION BY customer_type`, the `FIRST_VALUE` function will reset for each customer type, giving you the first billing address within each type.

In conclusion, using the `FIRST_VALUE` function with the `OVER` clause provides an efficient way to find the first occurrence of a billing address in a dataset. It allows you to extract the desired information based on specific conditions, making data manipulation tasks more manageable and efficient.
