In SQL, you can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the first occurrence of a supplier name from a dataset. This can be useful when you want to identify the initial supplier in a dataset or determine the earliest relationship between suppliers and products.

Here's an example of how to use `FIRST_VALUE` in a query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  product_id, 
  FIRST_VALUE(supplier_name) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS first_supplier
FROM 
  transactions;
```

In this example, the `FIRST_VALUE` function is applied to the `supplier_name` column. The `PARTITION BY` clause is used to group the data by `product_id`, and the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the data by `transaction_date`. By doing so, the `FIRST_VALUE` function returns the first supplier name for each product based on the earliest transaction date.

Here are some key points to note:

- The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to retrieve only unique combinations of `product_id` and `first_supplier`.
- The `OVER` clause is used in conjunction with `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` to define the window within which the `FIRST_VALUE` function operates.
- The result of the query will include the `product_id` and the corresponding `first_supplier` name for each product.

By utilizing the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you can easily identify the first occurrence of a supplier name in a dataset and gain valuable insights into the initial relationships between suppliers and products.
