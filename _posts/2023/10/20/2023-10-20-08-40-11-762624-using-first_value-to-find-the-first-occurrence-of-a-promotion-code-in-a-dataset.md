In SQL, the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be used to find the first occurrence of a particular value within a dataset. This can be useful when working with promotion codes or any other situation where you need to identify the earliest instance of a specific value.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function works by returning the first value from an ordered subset of data. Here's an example to illustrate how to use this function to find the first occurrence of a promotion code in a dataset.

Let's assume we have a table called `orders` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id int,
    promotion_code varchar,
    order_date date
);
```

To find the first occurrence of a promotion code, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause and the `ROW_NUMBER` function.

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    promotion_code,
    order_date,
    FIRST_VALUE(promotion_code) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS first_promotion_code
FROM
    orders;
```

In the above query, we are selecting the `order_id`, `promotion_code`, and `order_date` columns from the `orders` table. We are also using the `FIRST_VALUE` function with the `OVER` clause to order the data by the `order_date` column. The `first_promotion_code` column is then populated with the first occurrence of the promotion code.

This query returns a result set with the `order_id`, `promotion_code`, `order_date`, and `first_promotion_code` columns. The `first_promotion_code` column will contain the same value for all rows as it represents the first occurrence of a promotion code within the dataset.

By using the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you can easily identify the first occurrence of a promotion code in your dataset. This can be beneficial when analyzing customer behavior, tracking campaign effectiveness, or any other scenario where the first occurrence is significant.
