When working with datasets, it's common to encounter the need to find the maximum or minimum value for a specific column. In most cases, you would use the MAX or MIN functions to achieve this. However, there is another powerful function that can come in handy - FIRST_VALUE.

The FIRST_VALUE function is used to return the first value within a given set. In the context of finding the highest salary in a dataset, we can use FIRST_VALUE in conjunction with the ORDER BY clause.

Let's assume we have a table called "employees" with columns "name" and "salary". To find the employee with the highest salary, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM (
  SELECT name, salary, FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS max_salary
  FROM employees
) AS subquery
WHERE salary = max_salary;
```

In this query, we are selecting the "name" and "salary" columns from the subquery. The subquery itself is responsible for ordering the dataset by the "salary" column in descending order and using FIRST_VALUE to get the maximum salary. Finally, we filter the outer query to only return the rows where the salary matches the maximum salary found.

By using FIRST_VALUE in this way, we can easily identify the employee with the highest salary in the dataset. It's worth noting that if multiple employees have the same highest salary, this query will return all of them.

So, if you ever need to find the highest or lowest value in a dataset using SQL, give FIRST_VALUE a try. It's a powerful function that can simplify your queries and make your data analysis more efficient.
