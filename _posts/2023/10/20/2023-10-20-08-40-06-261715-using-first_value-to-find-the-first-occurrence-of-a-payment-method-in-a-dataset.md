When working with datasets, it is often necessary to find the first occurrence of a certain value within a set. In SQL, the `FIRST_VALUE` function provides a convenient way to accomplish this.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function allows you to select the first value in an ordered set of rows based on a specified column. In the context of finding the first occurrence of a payment method in a dataset, you can use this function to identify the initial payment method used by a customer.

Let's say we have a table called `orders` with the following columns: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `payment_method`, and `order_date`. To find the first payment method used by each customer, you can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, FIRST_VALUE(payment_method) 
  OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS first_payment_method
FROM orders;
```

In this SQL query, we use the `FIRST_VALUE` function with the `OVER` clause to specify the ordering of rows based on the `order_date` column. By using the `PARTITION BY` clause along with `customer_id`, we ensure that the first payment method is determined for each individual customer.

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove any duplicate rows in the result set, as we only want to display the first payment method for each customer.

By running this query, you will obtain a result set with two columns: `customer_id` and `first_payment_method`. Each row will contain the customer ID and the corresponding first payment method used by that customer.

Using the `FIRST_VALUE` function simplifies the process of finding the initial occurrence of a payment method in a dataset. It allows you to identify the first payment method used by customers without the need for complex subqueries or joins.
