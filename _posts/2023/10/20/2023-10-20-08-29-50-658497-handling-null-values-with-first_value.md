In SQL, the FIRST_VALUE function is used to return the first value in an ordered set of values. However, it can sometimes present a challenge when dealing with NULL values. In this blog post, we will discuss how to handle NULL values with the FIRST_VALUE function.

## What is FIRST_VALUE?

The FIRST_VALUE function is a window function in SQL that allows you to retrieve the first value in a group of rows based on a specified order. It is commonly used with the ORDER BY clause to determine the ordering of the rows.

The general syntax of the FIRST_VALUE function is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
  ORDER BY sort_expression
  [window_frame_clause]
)
```

## Handling NULL values

When using the FIRST_VALUE function, NULL values can cause unexpected results, especially when they are the first value in the ordering. By default, if the first value in the ordering is NULL, the FIRST_VALUE function will return NULL.

To handle NULL values with the FIRST_VALUE function, you can use the COALESCE function or the NULLS FIRST/LAST clause.

### Using COALESCE

The COALESCE function is used to return the first non-NULL value from a set of expressions. By wrapping the FIRST_VALUE function with the COALESCE function, you can specify a fallback value when the first value is NULL.

Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER(ORDER BY sort_column), 'fallback_value') AS first_value
FROM table_name;
```

In the above example, if the first_value is NULL, it will be replaced with the 'fallback_value'.

### Using NULLS FIRST/LAST clause

The NULLS FIRST/LAST clause is used to specify whether NULL values should be treated as the smallest or largest value when ordering the result set. By default, NULLS are treated as the smallest value.

You can use the NULLS FIRST clause to explicitly specify that NULL values are considered the smallest value. This ensures that the FIRST_VALUE function will not return a NULL value as the first value in the ordering. 

Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER(ORDER BY sort_column NULLS FIRST) AS first_value
FROM table_name;
```

In the above example, the NULLS FIRST clause ensures that NULL values are considered the smallest value when ordering the result set.

## Conclusion

When using the FIRST_VALUE function in SQL, handling NULL values is important to ensure the expected results. By using the COALESCE function or the NULLS FIRST/LAST clause, you can effectively handle NULL values and obtain the desired first value in a group of rows.

Remember to handle NULL values appropriately to avoid unexpected outcomes and ensure the correctness of your SQL queries and analyses.
