In SQL, the `FIRST_VALUE` function is used to return the first value in a specified column, based on the order specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. It is commonly used in scenarios where we need to retrieve the first value from a group of records.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the usage of `FIRST_VALUE`:

## Example 1: Retrieve the first and last names of the oldest employees

```sql
SELECT 
  FIRST_VALUE(first_name) OVER (ORDER BY age ASC) AS oldest_first_name,
  FIRST_VALUE(last_name) OVER (ORDER BY age ASC) AS oldest_last_name
FROM 
  employees
```

In this example, we retrieve the first and last names of the oldest employees from the `employees` table. The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used along with the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the records by age in ascending order. The result will display the first names and last names of the oldest employees.

## Example 2: Calculate the running total of sales

```sql
SELECT
  date,
  sales,
  FIRST_VALUE(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM
  sales_data
GROUP BY
  date, sales
```

In this example, we calculate the running total of sales using the `FIRST_VALUE` function. The `SUM(sales)` calculates the sum of sales for each date. By using the `OVER (ORDER BY date)` clause, we order the records by date to ensure the running total is calculated in the correct order. The result includes the date, sales amount, and the running total for each date.

These examples illustrate how the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be used in different scenarios to retrieve the first value from a specified column. Understanding and utilizing this function can greatly enhance your SQL queries.

> Remember that the actual usage of `FIRST_VALUE` may vary based on the specific database system you are using. Consult the documentation of your database system for precise syntax and additional examples.
