When working with datasets that contain multiple records with the same ZIP code, you may need to find the first occurrence of each unique ZIP code. In SQL, you can achieve this using the `FIRST_VALUE` function.

## What is FIRST_VALUE?

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is a window function in SQL that allows you to retrieve the first value from an ordered set of rows within a defined window frame. It is commonly used to find the first occurrence of a specific value within a dataset.

## Syntax of FIRST_VALUE

The syntax for `FIRST_VALUE` is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE (expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression] 
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC] 
    ROWS {UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | value PRECEDING})
```

- `expression`: The value you want to retrieve the first occurrence of.
- `PARTITION BY partition_expression`: Optional. Used to divide the dataset into partitions before applying the `FIRST_VALUE` function.
- `ORDER BY sort_expression`: Specifies the order in which the dataset should be sorted.
- `ROWS {UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | value PRECEDING}`: Specifies the window frame within which the `FIRST_VALUE` function operates.

## Example Usage

Let's consider a dataset with two columns - `zipcode` and `population`. We want to find the first occurrence of each unique ZIP code along with its corresponding population.

Here's an example SQL query that uses `FIRST_VALUE` to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FIRST_VALUE(zipcode) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode ORDER BY population ASC) AS first_zipcode,
    FIRST_VALUE(population) OVER (PARTITION BY zipcode ORDER BY population ASC) AS first_population
FROM 
    dataset_table
```

In this query, we use `FIRST_VALUE` to retrieve the first occurrence of `zipcode` and `population` within each partition defined by `zipcode`. We order the dataset by `population` in ascending order to ensure we get the earliest occurrence.

The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only the unique combinations of ZIP code and population are returned.

## Conclusion

Using the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL allows you to easily find the first occurrence of a ZIP code within a dataset. By partitioning and ordering the dataset appropriately, you can retrieve the earliest occurrence of each unique ZIP code along with its corresponding values.
