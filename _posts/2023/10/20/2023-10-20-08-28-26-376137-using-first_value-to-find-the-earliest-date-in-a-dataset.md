In SQL, there are many ways to determine the earliest date in a dataset. One useful function for this task is FIRST_VALUE, which allows you to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of data.

Let's say you have a table called `orders` with a column `order_date` that contains the order dates. You want to find the earliest date in this dataset. Here's how you can use the FIRST_VALUE function to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FIRST_VALUE(order_date) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ASC) AS earliest_date
FROM
    orders;
```

In the above code, the FIRST_VALUE function is applied to the `order_date` column and is ordered in ascending order using the `ORDER BY` clause. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only the earliest date is returned.

By running this query, you will get the earliest date present in the `order_date` column of the `orders` table.

Note: The FIRST_VALUE function is available in most modern SQL database systems, but syntax might vary slightly between different databases. Make sure to consult your database documentation for any specific requirements.

Using the FIRST_VALUE function can be helpful when you need to identify the earliest date in a dataset. It saves you from writing complex queries or subqueries to achieve the same result.

With FIRST_VALUE, you can easily retrieve the earliest date and incorporate this logic into more complex queries or data analysis tasks.

Happy coding!
