In SQL, there are various window functions that allow us to perform calculations on a specific set of rows within a result set. One such function is `FIRST_VALUE`, which can be used to retrieve the first value of a specific column within a partitioned dataset.

Let's say we have a table called `products` with the following structure:

| id  | name       | price |
|-----|------------|-------|
| 1   | Laptop     | 1200  |
| 2   | Smartphone | 800   |
| 3   | Monitor    | 300   |
| 4   | Laptop     | 1500  |
| 5   | Headphones | 100   |

If we want to find the first occurrence of each product name, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, 
       FIRST_VALUE(id) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY id) AS first_occurrence_id,
       FIRST_VALUE(price) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY id) AS first_occurrence_price
FROM products;
```

Here, we select distinct product names and use `FIRST_VALUE` to retrieve the first occurrence of the `id` and `price` columns for each product name. We partition the dataset by the `name` column and order the rows by `id` in ascending order.

The result of the above query will be:

| name       | first_occurrence_id | first_occurrence_price |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Laptop     | 1                   | 1200                  |
| Smartphone | 2                   | 800                   |
| Monitor    | 3                   | 300                   |
| Headphones | 5                   | 100                   |

In this result, we can see the first occurrence of each product name along with the corresponding `id` and `price` values.

Using `FIRST_VALUE` in this way can be useful when dealing with datasets where the order of occurrences matters, and you need to perform calculations or comparisons based on the first occurrence of a specific column.

In conclusion, the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL provides a simple and efficient way to find the first occurrence of a product name in a dataset while retaining the necessary contextual information. By utilizing the `OVER` clause and appropriate partitioning and ordering, you can retrieve the desired results.
