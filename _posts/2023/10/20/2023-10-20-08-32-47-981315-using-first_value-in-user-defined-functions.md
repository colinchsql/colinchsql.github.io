In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `FIRST_VALUE` function in user-defined functions (UDFs) in order to retrieve the first value in a sorted set of rows within the same group.

## Introduction
The `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL is used to retrieve the first value in a set of rows based on a specific ordering. This function can be extremely useful when working with complex queries or when you need to retrieve only the first value from a group of rows.

In the context of UDFs, the `FIRST_VALUE` function can be applied to obtain the first value within a group directly within the function's logic. This allows you to incorporate the functionality of `FIRST_VALUE` within your custom functions, providing more flexibility and control over the results.

## Syntax
The syntax for using the `FIRST_VALUE` function within a UDF is similar to regular SQL syntax. Here is the general syntax:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY column_to_group ORDER BY column_to_order)
```

- `column_name`: The name of the column from which you want to retrieve the first value.
- `column_to_group`: The column used to group the rows.
- `column_to_order`: The column used to determine the ordering of the rows within each group.

## Example
Let's consider a scenario where we want to create a UDF that calculates the average of a specific column for each group, and also returns the first value within each group. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_avg_and_first_value(column_to_calculate INT)
RETURNS TABLE (group_name TEXT, average_val NUMERIC, first_val INT)
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
    SELECT group_name,
           AVG(column_to_calculate),
           FIRST_VALUE(column_to_calculate) OVER (PARTITION BY group_name ORDER BY column_to_calculate)
    FROM your_table
    GROUP BY group_name;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, we define a UDF called `get_avg_and_first_value` that takes an input parameter `column_to_calculate`. The UDF returns a table with columns `group_name`, `average_val`, and `first_val`.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used within the UDF to retrieve the first value of `column_to_calculate` within each group, ordered by the column itself. This is achieved by using the `OVER` clause, partitioning by `group_name`, and ordering by `column_to_calculate`.

To use the UDF, you can simply call it in your SQL queries like any other function:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_avg_and_first_value(3);
```

This query will return the average of column 3 for each group, along with the first value of column 3 within each group.

## Conclusion
By using the `FIRST_VALUE` function within user-defined functions, you can incorporate this powerful functionality into your custom logic. This allows you to retrieve the first value within a group directly within your UDFs, providing more control and convenience in your data manipulation tasks.

Remember to use the correct syntax and input parameters when using `FIRST_VALUE` within your UDFs, and explore the possibilities of combining it with other SQL functions to achieve even more intricate data calculations. Happy coding!
