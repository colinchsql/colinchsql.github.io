When working with datasets, we often encounter scenarios where we need to find the first occurrence of a particular value. In SQL, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to achieve this.

The `FIRST_VALUE` function allows us to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of values, based on a specific ordering criteria. Let's explore how we can use `FIRST_VALUE` to find the first occurrence of a tax rate in a dataset.

## Syntax of `FIRST_VALUE`
The syntax of the `FIRST_VALUE` function is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE (expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC|DESC]
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

- `expression`: The value to retrieve the first occurrence of.
- `PARTITION BY partition_expression` (optional): Specifies how to partition the dataset into groups.
- `ORDER BY sort_expression` : Specifies the ordering criteria for the dataset.
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Specifies the range of rows used for the calculation.

## Example: Finding the first occurrence of a tax rate

Let's assume we have a dataset of products with their corresponding tax rates. We want to find the first occurrence of the tax rate for each product.

```sql
SELECT 
  product_id,
  tax_rate,
  FIRST_VALUE(tax_rate) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY created_at) AS first_tax_rate
FROM products
```

In this example, we are using the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the first tax rate for each product, ordered by the `created_at` column. By partitioning the dataset based on `product_id`, we ensure that the calculation is done per product.

The output will include the `product_id`, `tax_rate`, and `first_tax_rate` columns. The `first_tax_rate` column will contain the first occurrence of the tax rate for each product.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL, we can easily find the first occurrence of a specific value in a dataset. This can be particularly useful when dealing with ordered datasets and wanting to analyze or manipulate the first unique value.
