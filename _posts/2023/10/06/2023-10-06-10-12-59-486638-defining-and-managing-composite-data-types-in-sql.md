In SQL, composite data types are used to group multiple related values together under a single name. This allows for more structured and organized storage of data within a database. Composite data types are especially useful when dealing with complex data structures or when you want to encapsulate related attributes within a single object.

In this article, we will explore how to define and manage composite data types in SQL using examples.

## 1. Defining a Composite Data Type

To define a composite data type in SQL, you can use the `CREATE TYPE` statement. Let's say we want to define a composite data type called `Person` with attributes such as `name`, `age`, and `email`.

```sql
CREATE TYPE Person AS (
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In the example above, we define a composite data type `Person` using the `CREATE TYPE` statement. Inside the parentheses, we specify the attributes of the composite data type along with their respective data types.

## 2. Using the Composite Data Type

Once we have defined the composite data type, we can use it to declare variables, create tables, or define functions and procedures. Let's see some examples.

### 2.1 Declaring Variables

```sql
DECLARE p1 Person;

SET p1 = ('John Doe', 30, 'john.doe@example.com');
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `p1` of type `Person` and assign values to its attributes using the composite data type syntax.

### 2.2 Creating Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT,
    person Person
);
```

In this example, we create a table called `Employees` with attributes `id` and `person`. The `person` attribute is of type `Person`, allowing us to store a composite object within a table.

### 2.3 Defining Functions and Procedures

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getEmail(person Person) RETURNS VARCHAR(100)
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN person.email;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, we define a function `getEmail` that accepts a parameter of type `Person`. Inside the function, we can access the attributes of the composite data type to perform operations.

## 3. Managing Composite Data Types

To modify or drop a composite data type, you can use the `ALTER TYPE` or `DROP TYPE` statement, respectively.

```sql
ALTER TYPE Person ADD ATTRIBUTE phone VARCHAR(20);

ALTER TYPE Person DROP ATTRIBUTE email;
```

In the examples above, we add a new attribute `phone` to the `Person` composite data type using the `ALTER TYPE` statement. We can also remove attributes using the `DROP ATTRIBUTE` clause.

## Conclusion

Composite data types in SQL provide a powerful way to define and manage structured data within a database. By grouping related attributes under a single object, we can achieve better organization and maintainability of our data schemas.

By utilizing composite data types effectively, you can enhance the clarity, efficiency, and extensibility of your SQL code. So, the next time you come across a scenario where a composite data type can be beneficial, feel free to use this feature for improved data handling.
