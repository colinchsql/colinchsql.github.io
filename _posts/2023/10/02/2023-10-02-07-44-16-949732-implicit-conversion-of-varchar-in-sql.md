In SQL, *implicit conversion* refers to the automatic conversion of one data type to another by the database engine, without the need for explicit casting or conversion functions. This can be helpful when we need to compare or perform operations on different data types.

One common scenario where implicit conversion occurs is when working with the VARCHAR data type. VARCHAR is a variable-length character data type that can store alphanumeric characters and text.

Let's consider an example where we have a table with a VARCHAR column called "age" and we want to filter out all the rows where the age is greater than 30. However, the age column is stored as a VARCHAR data type.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE age > 30;
```

In this case, the database engine will perform an implicit conversion of the VARCHAR data to a numeric data type (such as INT or FLOAT) in order to compare it with the value 30. The conversion is based on the numeric value contained within the VARCHAR string.

However, it is important to note that implicit conversion can have some caveats. It may result in unexpected behavior or performance issues if the values in the VARCHAR column cannot be converted to the desired data type. It is always best practice to ensure that the data types being compared are compatible.

To avoid implicit conversion, you can explicitly convert the VARCHAR column to the desired data type using casting or conversion functions. For example:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE CAST(age AS INT) > 30;
```

In this case, we are explicitly converting the age column to INT using the CAST function before performing the comparison.

Using explicit conversion ensures that the comparison is done correctly and avoids any potential issues related to implicit conversion.
