In Oracle, the maximum length of a VARCHAR column is specified using a numeric value between 1 and 4000. If you need to store longer strings, you can use the VARCHAR2 data type, which has a maximum length of 4000 bytes.

To create a table with a VARCHAR column in Oracle, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
  id NUMBER,
  name VARCHAR2(50),
  description VARCHAR2(200)
);
```

In the example above, the `name` column is defined as VARCHAR2 with a maximum length of 50 characters, while the `description` column is defined with a maximum length of 200 characters.

When inserting values into a VARCHAR column, you need to make sure that the length of the string is within the specified limit. If you try to insert a longer string, Oracle will raise an error.

You can also perform various manipulations and operations on VARCHAR columns, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison. Oracle provides a rich set of built-in functions to handle string operations efficiently.

Using VARCHAR columns effectively can help optimize storage and improve performance in your Oracle database. By choosing the appropriate maximum length for your VARCHAR columns, you can ensure efficient data storage without wasting space.
