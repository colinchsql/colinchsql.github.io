One common scenario is performing a text search within a VARCHAR column. Let's imagine a scenario where we have a table called "products" with a VARCHAR column named "description". We want to search for all products that contain a specific word or phrase.

To accomplish this, we can use the SQL LIKE operator along with the '%' wildcard. The '%' symbol represents any sequence of characters, so we can use it to match patterns within the text. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE description LIKE '%keyword%';
```
In this example, replace "products" with the name of your table and "description" with the name of your VARCHAR column. Also, replace "keyword" with the word or phrase you want to search for.

It's important to note that the LIKE operator can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the database system you're using. For instance, in MySQL, by default, the LIKE operator performs a case-insensitive search, but you can modify that behavior using specific options.

Another approach for text search in SQL is using full-text search capabilities. Some database systems offer dedicated full-text search functionality, which is optimized for searching within large amounts of text data. These systems, like PostgreSQL and MySQL with the InnoDB engine, provide features like relevancy ranking, stemming, and phrase searching.

For example, in PostgreSQL, you can create a full-text search index on the VARCHAR column like this:

```sql
CREATE INDEX products_description_full_text_idx
ON products USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', description));
```

Then, to perform a full-text search, you can use the @@ operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE to_tsvector('english', description) @@ to_tsquery('search term');
```

Above, "english" represents the language of the text, and 'search term' represents the word or phrase you want to search for.

When using full-text search, make sure to consult the documentation of your specific database system to understand the available features and syntax.

In conclusion, performing text search within a VARCHAR column in SQL can be achieved using the LIKE operator with wildcard characters or leveraging the full-text search capabilities provided by certain database systems. By utilizing these methods correctly, you can effectively search and retrieve the desired text-based information from your database.
