Before diving into data versioning, let's briefly recap what a VARCHAR column is. VARCHAR is a data type in SQL that allows storing variable-length character strings. This means that the length of the data stored in a VARCHAR column can vary from one row to another.

When it comes to versioning VARCHAR columns, organizations can adopt different strategies based on their specific requirements and constraints. Below, we outline three commonly used approaches:

1. Full Column Versioning:
In this approach, the entire VARCHAR column is duplicated for each version. This means that whenever there is an update to a row, a new version of the entire VARCHAR column is created, including previously stored data. This approach ensures complete historical integrity but can be space-consuming, especially for large datasets.

Example code in SQL:
```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  data VARCHAR(max),
  version INT
);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, data, version)
VALUES (1, 'Version 1', 1);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, data, version)
VALUES (1, 'Version 2', 2);
```

2. Diff-based Versioning:
Instead of duplicating the entire VARCHAR column, this approach only stores the difference between consecutive versions. Each version of the VARCHAR column contains only the changes made to the previous version. This method can save storage space, but it requires more complex logic to retrieve and reconstruct the complete data for a specific version.

Example code in SQL:
```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  data_diff VARCHAR(max),  -- stores the diff between versions
  version INT
);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, data_diff, version)
VALUES (1, 'Version 1', 1);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, data_diff, version)
VALUES (1, '<<diff from Version 1 to Version 2>>', 2);
```

3. Separate History Table:
In this approach, a separate table is created specifically for storing historical versions of the VARCHAR column. The main table maintains the most recent version, while the history table stores all previous versions. This approach allows for efficient querying of the current version while keeping a complete history of changes, but it requires more complex SQL queries to retrieve data from both tables.

Example code in SQL:
```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  data VARCHAR(max),
  version INT
);

CREATE TABLE my_table_history (
  id INT,
  data VARCHAR(max),
  version INT
);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, data, version)
VALUES (1, 'Version 2', 2);

INSERT INTO my_table_history (id, data, version)
VALUES (1, 'Version 1', 1);
```

When choosing the right approach for VARCHAR data versioning, it is crucial to consider factors such as storage requirements, performance trade-offs, and ease of data retrieval. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific needs of your application.
