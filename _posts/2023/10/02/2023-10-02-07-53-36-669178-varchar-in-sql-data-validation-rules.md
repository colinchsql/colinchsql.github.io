VARCHAR columns in SQL are used to store variable-length character data. These columns can hold alphanumeric characters, including letters, numbers, and special symbols. To ensure the data being stored in VARCHAR columns adheres to specific rules, it is necessary to implement appropriate data validation techniques.

Here are a few common data validation rules that you can apply to VARCHAR columns in SQL:

1. Length Constraint:
   - Use the LENGTH or LEN functions to check the length of a VARCHAR value.
   - Set a minimum and maximum length using the appropriate functions for your database system (e.g., LENGTH() in MySQL or LEN() in SQL Server).
   - Example: `ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT username_length CHECK (LENGTH(username) BETWEEN 5 AND 20);`

2. Regular Expression Constraint:
   - Use regular expressions (regex) to define specific patterns that a VARCHAR value must match.
   - Regular expressions provide powerful pattern matching capabilities.
   - Most database systems have built-in functions to support regex matching (e.g., REGEXP_LIKE in Oracle, REGEXP_MATCHES in PostgreSQL).
   - Example: `ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT email_format CHECK (REGEXP_LIKE(email, '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'));`

3. Character Set Constraint:
   - Limit the characters that can be stored in a VARCHAR column to a specific character set.
   - This ensures that only allowed characters are inserted.
   - Many databases support the COLLATE clause to specify the desired character set for a column.
   - Example: `ALTER TABLE users MODIFY username VARCHAR(50) COLLATE utf8_general_ci;`

Remember, while implementing data validation rules, it is essential to strike a balance between strict validation and usability. Overly restrictive rules may lead to user frustration, while loose validation rules may compromise data integrity.
