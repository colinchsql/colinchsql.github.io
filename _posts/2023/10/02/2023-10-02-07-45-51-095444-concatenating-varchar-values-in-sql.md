To concatenate VARCHAR values in SQL, you can use the concatenation operator (+) or the CONCAT function, depending on the specific database system you are using.

Using the concatenation operator, you can simply use the (+) symbol to concatenate two or more VARCHAR values. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name
FROM employees
```

In the above example, the first_name and last_name columns are concatenated with a space in between, resulting in the full name of each employee.

If your database system supports the CONCAT function, you can use it to concatenate VARCHAR values. The CONCAT function takes two or more arguments and returns a single string. Here's an example using the CONCAT function:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees
```

In this example, the first_name and last_name columns are passed as separate arguments to the CONCAT function, with a space in between.

Using concatenation operators or the CONCAT function, you can concatenate multiple VARCHAR values in SQL to create more complex strings or generate dynamic queries.
