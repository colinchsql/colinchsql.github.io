In SQLite, VARCHAR is used to store variable-length alphanumeric data. It is typically used to store strings or text values. The maximum length for a VARCHAR column can be specified when creating the table.

Here's an example of a table creation statement in SQLite using VARCHAR:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In the above example, we created a table called "users" with three columns: "id", "name", and "email". The "id" column is defined as an INTEGER with PRIMARY KEY constraint, while the "name" and "email" columns are defined as VARCHAR with maximum lengths of 50 and 100 characters, respectively.

To insert data into the table, you can use the INSERT INTO statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

You can also retrieve data from the table using SELECT statements:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Using VARCHAR in SQLite allows you to store and manipulate textual data efficiently. It provides flexibility in handling variable-length strings within your database tables.
