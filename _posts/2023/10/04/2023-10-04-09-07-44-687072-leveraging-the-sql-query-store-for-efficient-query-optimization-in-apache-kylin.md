Apache Kylin is a powerful open-source analytics engine that enables users to run interactive SQL queries on large datasets. To ensure query performance and optimize the execution time, Kylin provides a feature called the SQL Query Store. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage the Query Store in Kylin to efficiently optimize queries.

## What is the SQL Query Store?

The SQL Query Store in Apache Kylin serves as a repository for storing and managing historical query execution plans. It captures various statistics about query performance, such as execution times, resource consumption, and query plans. These statistics are then used by Kylin's optimizer to make informed decisions for query optimization.

## Enabling the SQL Query Store

To begin leveraging the Query Store, you first need to enable it in your Apache Kylin instance. You can do this by adding the following configuration property to your `kylin.properties` file:

```
kylin.query.query-store.enabled=true
```

Once enabled, Kylin will start tracking query execution statistics and storing them in the Query Store.

## Analyzing Query Performance

After enabling the Query Store, you can start monitoring and analyzing the performance of your SQL queries. Kylin provides a user-friendly web interface that allows you to access the Query Store and explore various performance metrics. From the Query Store interface, you can view queries by execution time, resource consumption, or any other relevant metric.

Analyzing query performance will help you identify any bottlenecks or areas for optimization. You can identify the queries that take the longest to execute, consume the most resources, or have suboptimal execution plans.

## Query Optimization using Query Store

The SQL Query Store in Kylin not only provides insights into query performance but also offers optimization capabilities based on historical data. Kylin's optimizer can analyze the execution plans stored in the Query Store and make recommendations for improving query performance.

By examining the historical query plans, Kylin can identify patterns and suggest changes to queries that can result in faster execution times. This could involve adjusting join orders, changing aggregation strategies, or adding indexes to the underlying data.

## Implementing Query Optimizations

Once you have identified queries that can benefit from optimization, you can implement the suggested changes in your code. This may involve rewriting parts of the query, adjusting the schema, or applying new indexing strategies.

By leveraging the insights provided by the Query Store, you can make targeted optimizations that result in significant performance improvements. However, it's important to verify the changes by running performance tests before deploying them to a production environment.

## Conclusion

The SQL Query Store in Apache Kylin is a valuable resource for query optimization. By capturing and analyzing historical query execution plans, Kylin's Query Store enables users to identify performance bottlenecks and make targeted optimizations. Leveraging the Query Store can greatly enhance the performance of SQL queries and improve the overall efficiency of your Apache Kylin instance.
