In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage the SQL Query Store feature in Microsoft SQL Server to benchmark the performance of your queries. The Query Store is a powerful tool that captures and stores query execution plans, runtime statistics, and query history. We will walk through the process of setting up and using the Query Store for benchmarking purposes.

## Introduction to SQL Query Store

The SQL Query Store is a feature available in SQL Server 2016 and above that provides comprehensive insights into query performance. It captures various performance-related metrics such as execution plans, runtime statistics, and resource consumption for each query executed against the database. This information can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, analyze query regressions, and optimize query performance.

## Enabling the Query Store

To enable the Query Store for a database, you can use the following T-SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName] SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```

Enabling the Query Store will start capturing query execution data for the database. By default, the data retention period is set to 30 days, but you can configure it based on your requirements.

## Query Performance Monitoring

Once the Query Store is enabled, it starts capturing the execution data for all the queries. You can monitor query performance using the following built-in views:

- sys.query_store_query
- sys.query_store_query_text
- sys.query_store_runtime_stats

These views provide information about average CPU time, logical reads, execution count, and other crucial performance metrics for each query. You can use these views to identify poorly performing queries and track their performance over time.

## Analyzing Query Performance

To analyze the performance of individual queries, you can compare different execution plans for the same query using the sys.query_store_plan view. This view provides details about different execution plans along with their performance statistics.

You can also use the built-in reports in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to analyze query performance trends and identify performance regressions. These reports provide graphical representations of query metrics and can help you make informed decisions about query optimization.

## Query Store Configuration

The Query Store offers various configuration settings that can be customized according to your specific requirements. Some important configuration options include:

- **Data Flush Interval**: Specifies the frequency at which query execution data is flushed from memory to disk.
- **Max Storage Size**: Defines the maximum size of the Query Store data.
- **Stale Query Threshold**: Determines when a query is considered stale and its execution plan is evicted from the Query Store.

Configuring these settings properly ensures efficient utilization of resources and allows for better analysis of query performance.

## Conclusion

The SQL Query Store is a powerful tool that enables query performance benchmarking and analysis. By leveraging the Query Store, you can identify performance bottlenecks, track query performance over time, and optimize database performance. Understanding how to enable and configure the Query Store, as well as utilize its built-in views and reports, will greatly enhance your ability to optimize SQL query performance. Start leveraging the Query Store today and unlock the full potential of your SQL Server database.
