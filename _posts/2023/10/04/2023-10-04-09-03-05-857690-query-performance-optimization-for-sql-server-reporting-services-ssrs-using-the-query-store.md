As a SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) developer or administrator, you may encounter performance issues when generating reports. Slow queries can affect the overall performance and user experience of your SSRS application. However, with the introduction of the Query Store feature in SQL Server, optimizing query performance has become easier and more efficient.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Query Store to identify and optimize slow queries in SSRS, improving the overall performance of your reports.

## What is the Query Store?
(#what-is-the-query-store)

The Query Store is a powerful performance monitoring feature introduced in SQL Server 2016 and onwards. It collects and stores execution statistics, query plans, and runtime information for every query executed against a specific database. It allows you to track query performance over time, compare different execution plans, and make informed decisions for query optimization.

## Enabling and Configuring the Query Store
(#enabling-and-configuring-the-query-store)

To enable the Query Store for a particular database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), follow these steps:

1. Right-click the target database and select "Properties."
2. Go to the "Query Store" tab.
3. Set the "Operation Mode" to either "Read-Write" or "Read-Only" based on your requirements.
4. Adjust the "Data Flush Interval (Minutes)" and "Statistics Collection Interval (Minutes)" settings as per your preference.
5. Click "OK" to enable the Query Store.

## Identifying Slow Queries
(#identifying-slow-queries)

Once the Query Store is enabled, you can easily identify slow queries by querying the relevant views and functions present in the Query Store.

Here's an example query to identify the top 10 longest running queries:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    qt.query_text_id,
    qt.query_sql_text,
    qsp.count_executions,
    qsp.avg_duration,
    qsp.avg_cpu_time,
    qsp.avg_logical_io_reads
FROM sys.query_store_query_text AS qt
JOIN sys.query_store_plan AS qp 
    ON qt.query_text_id = qp.query_text_id
JOIN sys.query_store_runtime_stats AS qsp 
    ON qp.plan_id = qsp.plan_id
ORDER BY qsp.avg_duration DESC;
```

## Analyzing Query Execution Plans
(#analyzing-query-execution-plans)

The Query Store provides detailed information about different execution plans generated for each query. By comparing execution plans, you can identify the most efficient plan for a specific query.

To analyze query execution plans in SSMS:

1. Open a query window in SSMS.
2. Switch on the "Query Store" toolbar by going to "View" > "Toolbars" > "Query Store."
3. Execute the desired query.
4. Right-click on the query in the "Query Store" toolbar and select "Compare Plans."
5. Analyze the different plans and choose the one with the lowest overall cost.

## Query Performance Tuning
(#query-performance-tuning)

After identifying slow queries and analyzing execution plans, you can take the following steps to improve their performance:

- **Index Optimization**: Review the generated execution plans and identify missing or inefficient indexes. Create or modify indexes to enhance query performance.
- **Query Rewrite**: Analyze the query logic and rewrite the query if needed. Consider using efficient JOINs or subqueries to eliminate unnecessary data retrieval operations.
- **Parameter Sniffing**: Identify if the query performance issue is due to parameter sniffing. Use query hints or local variables to mitigate the performance impact.
- **Statistics Update**: Update statistics to ensure the query optimizer has up-to-date information for generating efficient execution plans.

Remember to test your optimizations before implementing them in a production environment.

## Monitoring Query Performance
(#monitoring-query-performance)

The Query Store provides several views and functions to monitor query performance over time. You can track query execution statistics, plan changes, and resource consumption using these features.

Continuously monitor the performance of your SSRS reports by periodically reviewing the Query Store information and taking necessary actions to optimize query performance.

## Conclusion
(#conclusion)

The Query Store feature in SQL Server provides a powerful tool for identifying and optimizing slow queries in SSRS. By enabling and configuring the Query Store, you can easily identify performance bottlenecks, analyze execution plans, and implement query performance optimizations.

Remember to regularly monitor the Query Store to ensure ongoing performance improvements for your SSRS reports. With these techniques, you can enhance the user experience and overall efficiency of your SSRS application.

Happy Query Store optimization!
