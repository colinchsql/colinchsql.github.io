Apache Hive is a powerful data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Apache Hadoop. It provides a way to query and analyze large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). However, as the size of the data increases, query performance can become a challenge. To address this, Apache Hive introduced the SQL Query Store feature, which helps optimize query performance. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques for optimizing query performance in Apache Hive using the SQL Query Store.

## 1. Introduction
Apache Hive is widely used for big data processing, but as the volume of data grows, query performance can degrade. The SQL Query Store feature in Hive provides insights into query performance, allowing you to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

## 2. What is the SQL Query Store?
The SQL Query Store is a feature in Apache Hive that captures and stores query execution plans, runtime statistics, and other metadata. It enables tracking and monitoring of query performance over time, making it easier to identify queries that are consuming excessive resources or taking too long to execute.

## 3. Enabling the SQL Query Store
To enable the SQL Query Store in Hive, you need to set the `hive.query.store.enable` configuration property to true. This can be done either in the Hive configuration file (`hive-site.xml`) or at runtime using the `SET` command.

```
SET hive.query.store.enable=true;
```

## 4. Analyzing Query Execution Plans
The SQL Query Store stores the execution plans of queries, which can be analyzed to understand how queries are being processed. Analyzing execution plans helps identify potential performance bottlenecks such as full table scans or unnecessary shuffles.

To retrieve the execution plan for a specific query, you can use the `EXPLAIN` command.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE column = 'value';
```

## 5. Identifying and Optimizing Expensive Queries
The SQL Query Store tracks runtime statistics for queries, including execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption. By analyzing these statistics, you can identify queries that are consuming excessive resources and optimize them for better performance.

One approach is to use the `ANALYZE TABLE` command to collect statistics on the tables used by the queries. This helps Hive make informed decisions about query execution plans based on actual data distribution and cardinality.

```sql
ANALYZE TABLE my_table COMPUTE STATISTICS;
```

Another technique is to leverage the Hive `SORT BY` clause to sort the data before processing. Sorting the data can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data to process during joins and aggregations.

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table SORT BY column;
```

## 6. Monitoring Query Performance
The SQL Query Store provides a set of views and functions that allow you to monitor query performance. These views include `QUERY_SUMMARY`, `QUERY_INSTANCE`, and `QUERY_PLAN`. These views can be queried to retrieve information about query execution times, resource usage, and execution plans.

```sql
SELECT * FROM QUERY_SUMMARY;
SELECT * FROM QUERY_INSTANCE WHERE query_id = '12345';
SELECT * FROM QUERY_PLAN WHERE query_id = '12345';
```

## 7. Conclusion
Optimizing query performance is crucial for efficient big data processing. Apache Hive's SQL Query Store feature provides valuable insights into query execution plans and runtime statistics, helping you identify and optimize expensive queries. By enabling the SQL Query Store, analyzing execution plans, and monitoring performance, you can achieve significant performance improvements in Apache Hive.
