## Overview of SQL Query Store
The SQL Query Store is a feature introduced in Microsoft SQL Server 2016 that helps track query performance over time. It captures query execution plans and runtime statistics, allowing database administrators to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. By leveraging the SQL Query Store, you can gain insights into query behavior and identify opportunities for optimization.

## Enabling and Configuring the SQL Query Store
Before you can start analyzing query parameters, you need to enable and configure the SQL Query Store on your SQL Server instance. The process involves enabling the Query Store feature, setting the desired Query Store configuration options, and specifying the retention period for query data. Once enabled, the SQL Query Store will start capturing the necessary information for analysis.

## Analyzing Query Parameters
Once the SQL Query Store is capturing query data, you can begin analyzing query parameters. Query parameters refer to the variables or placeholders used in parameterized queries. By examining the performance of different parameter values, you can identify patterns and trends that affect query performance.

## Identifying Parameter Sensitive Queries
To identify parameter sensitive queries, you can use the Query Store views and functions provided by SQL Server. By querying the `sys.query_store_query_parameters` view, you can retrieve information about the parameters used in each query execution. This allows you to determine if certain parameters have a significant impact on query performance.

## Optimizing Parameterized Queries
After identifying parameter sensitive queries, you can take steps to optimize their performance. One approach is to use parameter sniffing to ensure the execution plan is optimal for different parameter values. You can achieve this by using the `OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN` query hint or creating separate execution plans for different parameter values using plan guides.

## Conclusion
Analyzing query parameters and their impact on performance is crucial for optimizing database performance. By leveraging the SQL Query Store, you can gain valuable insights into query behavior and make informed decisions to improve performance. Configuring the Query Store, identifying parameter sensitive queries, and optimizing parameterized queries are essential steps to ensure optimal query performance.
