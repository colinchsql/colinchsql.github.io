In a modern database system, the ability to monitor and analyze query execution parallelism is crucial for optimizing database performance. By understanding how queries are being executed in parallel, database administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall query performance.

In this article, we will explore how to leverage the SQL Query Store, a built-in feature in Microsoft SQL Server, to monitor and analyze query execution parallelism. We will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to the SQL Query Store
2. Enabling the Query Store
3. Collecting and Viewing Query Execution Parallelism Data
4. Analyzing Parallelism Patterns
5. Optimizing Query Performance

## 1. Introduction to the SQL Query Store

The SQL Query Store is a powerful tool that captures query performance data, execution plans, and query statistics in a database. It provides a wealth of information about query performance, including execution time, resource usage, and parallelism.

## 2. Enabling the Query Store

Before we can start monitoring query execution parallelism, we need to enable the Query Store for our database. To do this, we can use the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName] SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```

## 3. Collecting and Viewing Query Execution Parallelism Data

Once the Query Store is enabled, it starts collecting data about query execution parallelism. We can view this data using the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.query_store_runtime_stats
WHERE execution_type = 'Parallel';
```

This query will return a result set that includes information about the queries that have been executed in parallel, including their execution time, resource usage, and other relevant details.

## 4. Analyzing Parallelism Patterns

To analyze query execution parallelism patterns, we can use various techniques and queries. One common approach is to group queries by their execution time and resource usage and identify any recurring patterns or outliers.

For example, we can use the following query to group queries by their average parallelism degree:

```sql
SELECT avg_parallel_degree, COUNT(*)
FROM sys.query_store_runtime_stats
WHERE execution_type = 'Parallel'
GROUP BY avg_parallel_degree;
```

This query will provide valuable insights into the distribution of parallelism degrees among queries and help identify any queries that consistently use a higher or lower degree of parallelism.

## 5. Optimizing Query Performance

By monitoring and analyzing query execution parallelism with the SQL Query Store, we can identify opportunities for optimizing query performance. For example, by identifying queries that consistently use a high degree of parallelism, we can investigate if fine-tuning the query or adjusting resource allocation can improve overall performance.

Additionally, by identifying queries that experience reduced parallelism or encounter bottlenecks, we can investigate possible causes such as resource contention or inefficient query plans and take corrective actions to optimize performance.

## Conclusion

Monitoring and analyzing query execution parallelism using the SQL Query Store is an essential aspect of database performance optimization. By leveraging the wealth of information provided by the Query Store, administrators can gain insights into query performance, identify patterns, and make informed decisions to optimize query execution.

With a deep understanding of query execution parallelism, administrators can not only improve database performance but also enhance customer experiences and optimize utilization of system resources.
