The SQL Query Store is a powerful feature in Microsoft SQL Server that helps administrators and developers analyze query performance. It provides insight into query execution plans, resource consumption, and query statistics, enabling you to identify and address performance issues. In this blog post, we will discuss how to use the SQL Query Store to analyze and identify the root cause of query performance issues.

## Introduction

Query performance issues can have a significant impact on the overall performance of your SQL Server database. Slow-running queries can cause bottlenecks, increased resource consumption, and degrade the user experience. The SQL Query Store provides a historical view of query execution data, enabling you to identify and troubleshoot performance problems.

## Enabling and Configuring Query Store

To start using the SQL Query Store, you need to enable and configure it for your database. You can enable Query Store at the database level or at the individual query level. By default, Query Store is disabled for new databases, so you need to enable it manually. Use the following T-SQL command to enable Query Store for a specific database:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE DatabaseName SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```

Once enabled, you can configure various Query Store options, such as data retention period, size limit, and capture mode, according to your requirements.

## Identifying Problematic Queries

Once Query Store is enabled, it will start capturing query execution data, including query plans, runtime statistics, and resource consumption. You can use the Query Store views and functions to identify problematic queries based on factors like execution time, CPU usage, and I/O usage. The sys.query_store_query view provides a list of queries with performance data, which you can sort and filter based on various metrics.

## Analyzing Query Execution Plans

Query execution plans play a vital role in query performance. With Query Store, you can easily access the execution plans for your queries and analyze them to identify performance issues. The sys.query_store_plan view provides detailed information about the execution plans for individual queries. You can compare plans, track plan changes over time, and identify potential bottlenecks or regressions in plan performance.

## Monitoring Query Performance

Query Store provides several built-in reports and views that allow you to monitor the overall performance of your queries. You can use the top resource-consuming queries report to identify queries that consume the most CPU, I/O, or memory resources. The query performance insight report helps you identify queries with the highest average execution time. Monitoring these metrics can give you a clear understanding of query performance patterns and potential areas for optimization.

## Optimizing Query Performance

Once you have identified problematic queries and potential performance issues, you can take steps to optimize query performance. Query Store provides the ability to force a specific execution plan for a query, enabling you to choose the most optimal plan for improved performance. You can also utilize the Database Engine Tuning Advisor to analyze and suggest index improvements for your queries.

## Conclusion

The SQL Query Store is a powerful tool for analyzing and identifying the root cause of query performance issues in your SQL Server database. By enabling and configuring Query Store, you can gather vital information about query execution, analyze query plans, and monitor query performance. This helps you optimize and enhance the overall performance of your database, resulting in improved user experience and increased efficiency.
