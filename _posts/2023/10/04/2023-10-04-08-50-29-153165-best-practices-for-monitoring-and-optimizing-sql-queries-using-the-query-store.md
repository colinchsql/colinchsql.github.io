In today's fast-paced digital world, efficient querying and optimal performance of SQL queries are crucial for the success of any application or database. This is where the Query Store feature comes into play. Query Store, introduced in Microsoft SQL Server 2016, is a powerful tool that helps you monitor and optimize SQL queries. In this blog post, we will discuss some best practices for effectively utilizing the Query Store feature to improve the performance of your SQL queries.

## What is Query Store?

Query Store is a database-level feature in SQL Server that captures and stores query execution plans, query runtime statistics, and query history. It provides a historical view of query performance, allowing developers and database administrators to analyze query behavior over time. By identifying and addressing the problematic queries, you can optimize the application's overall performance.

## Enable Query Store

To start using Query Store, enable it on your database by executing the following command:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabase] SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```

This command enables Query Store on the specified database, allowing it to begin capturing query data.

## Monitoring Query Performance

Once Query Store is enabled, you can monitor query performance using the following techniques:

### 1. Query Store Dashboard

SQL Server Management Studio provides a graphical Query Store Dashboard that allows you to monitor and analyze the performance of individual queries or groups of queries. The dashboard provides key metrics such as query duration, CPU usage, and execution counts, helping you identify queries that require optimization.

### 2. Query Store Views and Functions

Query Store provides a set of system views and functions that allow you to extract detailed information about query performance. Some useful views and functions include:

- sys.query_store_query: Stores information about individual queries.
- sys.query_store_plan: Contains information about query plans.
- sys.query_store_runtime_stats: Captures runtime statistics for each query execution.

By querying these views and functions, you can gain deeper insights into query performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Query Performance Optimization

Once you have identified queries that are performing poorly, the Query Store can help you optimize their execution. Here are some best practices to follow:

### 1. Analyze Execution Plans

Use the Query Store to compare different execution plans for the same query. Analyze the plans to identify potential performance bottlenecks such as missing indexes, incorrect join types, or excessive data movement. Use tools like the Actual Execution Plan feature in SQL Server Management Studio or the Query Store's graphical interface to assess and compare execution plans.

### 2. Force Query Plan

If you identify a query with a suboptimal execution plan, you can force the optimizer to use a specific plan that you know performs better. This can be done using the Query Store or by using the 'USE PLAN' hint directly in the query. **However, be cautious when forcing query plans, as it may not always result in improved performance and can have unintended consequences.**

### 3. Rewrite or Refactor Queries

The Query Store can help you identify queries that are consuming excessive resources or not performing as expected. Use this information to rewrite or refactor the queries to improve performance. Consider optimizing join conditions, removing unnecessary subqueries, or rewriting complex WHERE clauses. Always thoroughly test the optimized queries before deploying them in production.

### 4. Index Optimization

Check the Query Store data to identify queries that are missing appropriate indexes. Use this information to create or modify indexes to improve query performance. Be cautious not to over-index, as it can lead to decreased insert/update performance.

### 5. Monitor Query Store Data Growth

Query Store captures a significant amount of data over time, which can impact your database's overall performance and storage requirements. Monitor the growth of Query Store data and set appropriate retention policies to manage its size. Be mindful of the impact on disk space and regularly clean up unnecessary old data.

## Conclusion

The Query Store feature in SQL Server provides valuable insights into query performance, enabling you to monitor, analyze, and optimize SQL queries effectively. By following the best practices mentioned above, you can improve the overall performance of your database, resulting in a seamless and efficient application experience.
