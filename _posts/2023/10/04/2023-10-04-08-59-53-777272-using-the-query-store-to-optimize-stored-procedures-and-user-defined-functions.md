In this blog post, we will explore how to use the Query Store feature in SQL Server to optimize the performance of stored procedures and user-defined functions. The Query Store is a powerful tool that captures query execution plans and runtime statistics, allowing you to identify and resolve performance issues.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
The Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016 and is available in all editions. It provides a convenient way to analyze query performance and troubleshoot issues without the need for third-party tools.

## Enabling the Query Store<a name="enabling-the-query-store"></a>
To begin using the Query Store, you need to enable it for your database. This can be done through the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or using T-SQL statements.

To enable the Query Store via SSMS, right-click on your database, select "Properties," then navigate to the "Query Store" tab. From there, you can enable and configure the Query Store settings.

Alternatively, you can enable the Query Store using T-SQL:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabase] SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```

## Monitoring Query Performance<a name="monitoring-query-performance"></a>
Once the Query Store is enabled, it starts capturing query information, including execution plans, runtime statistics, and wait statistics. To monitor query performance, you can use built-in reports in SSMS or query the sys.query_store views directly.

The built-in reports provide valuable insights into top resource-consuming queries, execution plan changes over time, and query wait statistics. You can access these reports by right-clicking on the database, selecting "Reports," and navigating to the "Standard Reports" or "Custom Reports" sections.

Alternatively, you can query the sys.query_store views to build your custom reports or perform more specific analysis.

## Identifying Performance Issues<a name="identifying-performance-issues"></a>
Using the Query Store data, you can identify performance issues by analyzing query execution plans and analyzing runtime statistics. Look for long-running queries, high CPU utilization, or excessive I/O operations.

By comparing the execution plans and statistics before and after making changes to your stored procedures or user-defined functions, you can determine the impact of your optimizations.

## Forcing Execution Plans<a name="forcing-execution-plans"></a>
In some cases, you may want to force a specific execution plan for a query to ensure consistent performance. The Query Store allows you to do this by using plan regression capabilities.

You can identify the query you want to force a plan for, and choose the desired execution plan from the available options. Once you force a plan, SQL Server will use the specified plan for that query until you change it.

## Summary<a name="summary"></a>
The Query Store is a powerful feature in SQL Server that allows you to optimize the performance of stored procedures and user-defined functions. By enabling the Query Store, monitoring query performance, identifying bottlenecks, and forcing execution plans, you can significantly improve the overall performance of your database applications.

Start leveraging the Query Store today and take control of your query performance!
