## Introduction to SQL Query Store

SQL Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016 and has since become one of the most important performance tuning features in the relational database engine. It acts as a flight data recorder for your database, capturing a wealth of information about executed queries, plans, and their performance characteristics.

## Understanding SQL Query Store Statistics

SQL Query Store provides various statistics that can help you analyze the performance of your queries. These statistics include execution counts, average execution time, and resource consumption metrics. We will take a closer look at how these statistics are collected and how they can be used to identify performance issues.

## Working with SQL Query Store Metrics

Metrics in SQL Query Store are derived from the collected statistics and provide more granular information about query performance. We will explore how to interpret these metrics and use them to optimize query execution plans.

## Query Store Metadata Tables

SQL Query Store uses a set of metadata tables to store the collected information about queries and plans. We will discuss the structure of these tables and show you how to query them to extract valuable insights about your database performance.

## Query Store Interoperability

SQL Query Store is designed to be compatible with other SQL Server features and tools. We will explore how you can leverage Query Store with other performance tuning features, such as Query Store Advisor and Automatic Plan Correction.

## Conclusion

SQL Query Store is a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing query performance in SQL Server. By understanding the internals of Query Store statistics and metrics, you can gain valuable insights into your database performance and make informed decisions for query tuning.
