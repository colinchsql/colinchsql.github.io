## Introduction to SQLite
SQLite is a C library that provides a self-contained, serverless, transactional SQL database engine. It is widely used in mobile and embedded platforms due to its small footprint and simplicity. SQLite databases are stored as single files, making them easy to manage and transport.

## Deleting Data using SQL DELETE Statement
The most straightforward way to delete data from an SQLite database is by using the SQL DELETE statement. The DELETE statement removes one or more rows from a table based on specified conditions.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

For example, to delete a specific row from the "users" table where the "id" column matches a certain value:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## Deleting Data using Prepared Statements
Using prepared statements provides an extra layer of security and can help prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements allow you to execute the same SQL statement repeatedly with different parameter values.

Here's an example of deleting data using prepared statements in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?"
params = (1,)
cursor.execute(sql, params)

connection.commit()
connection.close()
```

## Deleting Data using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
If you are using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library such as SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM, deleting data becomes even more convenient. ORM libraries provide a higher-level abstraction over the database, allowing you to delete records using object-oriented syntax.

Here's an example using SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()


class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///database.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

user = session.query(User).get(1)
session.delete(user)
session.commit()
session.close()
```

## Conclusion
Deleting data from an SQLite database can be achieved using various methods, depending on your preferred approach and the tools you are using. Whether you choose to write raw SQL statements, use prepared statements, or leverage an ORM library, SQLite's flexibility allows you to tailor the deletion process to fit your needs.
