SQLite is a popular relational database management system that provides efficient storage and retrieval of data. Constraints in SQLite are rules that are applied to the data stored in the tables to ensure data integrity and enforce business logic. In this blog post, we will explore the different types of constraints available in SQLite and how to use them effectively in your database schema.

## NOT NULL Constraint

The `NOT NULL` constraint is used to ensure that a column does not contain any NULL values. It specifies that the column must have a value when a new row is inserted into the table or when an existing row is updated.

To add the `NOT NULL` constraint to a column, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER
);
```

In the example above, the `name` column is defined with the `NOT NULL` constraint. This means that every row inserted into the `employees` table must have a non-null value for the `name` column.

## UNIQUE Constraint

The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique. It prevents duplicate values from being inserted into the column.

To add the `UNIQUE` constraint to a column, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    student_number TEXT UNIQUE,
    name TEXT
);
```

In the example above, the `student_number` column is defined with the `UNIQUE` constraint. This means that each row inserted into the `students` table must have a unique value for the `student_number` column.

## PRIMARY KEY Constraint

The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. It can consist of one or more columns, and its values must be unique and not null.

To add the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint to a column, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name TEXT,
    quantity INTEGER
);
```

In the example above, the `order_id` column is defined as the `PRIMARY KEY` of the `orders` table. This means that each row in the `orders` table will have a unique and non-null value for the `order_id` column.

## CHECK Constraint

The `CHECK` constraint is used to specify a condition that must be true for a row to be inserted or updated in a table.

To add the `CHECK` constraint to a column, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    year INTEGER CHECK (year >= 1900)
);
```

In the example above, the `year` column is defined with the `CHECK` constraint, which ensures that the `year` value is greater than or equal to 1900.

## FOREIGN KEY Constraint

The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is used to enforce referential integrity between two related tables. It ensures that the values in a column of one table match the values in another table's primary key or unique key column.

To add the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint to a column, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);
```

In the example above, the `customer_id` column in the `orders` table is defined as a `FOREIGN KEY` that references the `id` column in the `customers` table. This enforces the relationship between the `orders` and `customers` tables, ensuring that an `order` can only be associated with a valid `customer`.

## Conclusion

SQLite constraints play a vital role in maintaining the consistency and integrity of the data stored in a database. By applying constraints, you can prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being inserted or updated in your tables. Understanding the different types of constraints available in SQLite and how to use them correctly can greatly enhance the reliability and usability of your database.
