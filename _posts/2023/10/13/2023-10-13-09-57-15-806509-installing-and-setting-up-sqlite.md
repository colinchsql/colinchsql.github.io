3. Download the appropriate "sqlite-tools" zip file.
4. Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice.
5. Add the directory where you extracted the files to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### macOS

## Conclusion
Installing and setting up SQLite is relatively simple, and it provides a lightweight yet powerful database management system for your applications. Whether you use it through the command line or with a GUI tool, SQLite offers an efficient way to store and query structured data.
