In database management systems, a transaction is a logical unit of work that consists of one or more database operations. These operations are executed together as a single, indivisible unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring data integrity.

SQLite, a popular lightweight relational database management system, provides support for transactions. Transactions in SQLite help maintain the consistency and integrity of the database by ensuring that a series of operations are treated as a single atomic unit.

## Starting a Transaction

You can start a transaction in SQLite by using the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement. This marks the beginning of the transaction and ensures that subsequent database operations are handled within the context of this transaction. Additionally, you can use the `BEGIN DEFERRED TRANSACTION` statement to start a transaction in deferred mode.

Here's an example of starting a transaction in SQLite:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

## Committing a Transaction

Once you have performed all the necessary database operations within a transaction, you need to commit the transaction to make the changes permanent. To commit a transaction in SQLite, you use the `COMMIT` statement.

Here's an example of committing a transaction in SQLite:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

## Rolling Back a Transaction

If any error occurs during a transaction or if you want to discard the changes made within a transaction, you can roll back the transaction. Rolling back a transaction undoes all the changes made since the transaction was started.

To roll back a transaction in SQLite, you use the `ROLLBACK` statement.

Here's an example of rolling back a transaction in SQLite:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## Nested Transactions

SQLite does not support true nested transactions. However, it provides a mechanism to simulate nested behavior using savepoints. Savepoints allow you to create points within a transaction where you can roll back to a specific point without rolling back the entire transaction.

Here's an example of using savepoints in SQLite:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SAVEPOINT point1;
-- Perform database operations
ROLLBACK TO point1;
-- Continue with other operations
COMMIT;
```

## Conclusion

Transactions are an essential feature in database management systems, including SQLite. They ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of database operations. Understanding how to use transactions in SQLite allows you to handle complex database interactions and maintain data integrity.
