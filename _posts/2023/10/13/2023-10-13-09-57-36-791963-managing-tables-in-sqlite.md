SQLite is a popular embedded database management system that provides a lightweight and efficient way to store and access structured data. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of managing tables in SQLite.

## Table Creation

To create a table in SQLite, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. This statement specifies the table name and defines the column names and their corresponding data types.

Here's an example of how to create a simple table with two columns, `id` and `name`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);
```

In the above example, we define the `id` column as the primary key using the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint. The `name` column is of type `TEXT`.

## Inserting Data

Once you have created a table, you can insert data into it using the `INSERT INTO` statement. This statement allows you to specify the table name and the values to be inserted.

Here's an example:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
```

In this example, we insert a record with `id` 1 and name 'John Doe' into the `students` table.

## Querying Data

To retrieve data from a table, you can use the `SELECT` statement. This statement allows you to specify the columns to be retrieved and any conditions for filtering the data.

Here's an example of how to retrieve all the records from the `students` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

This statement will return all the columns and records from the `students` table.

## Updating Data

To update data in a table, you can use the `UPDATE` statement. This statement allows you to specify the table name, the columns to be updated, and the new values.

Here's an example of how to update the name of a student with `id` 1:

```sql
UPDATE students SET name = 'Jane Smith' WHERE id = 1;
```

In this example, we update the `name` column of the record with `id` 1 to 'Jane Smith'.

## Deleting Data

To delete data from a table, you can use the `DELETE FROM` statement. This statement allows you to specify the table name and any conditions for filtering the data to be deleted.

Here's an example of how to delete a student with `id` 1 from the `students` table:

```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;
```

This statement will delete the record with `id` 1 from the `students` table.

## Conclusion

Managing tables in SQLite is straightforward and can be done using simple SQL statements. With the ability to create tables, insert data, query data, update data, and delete data, SQLite provides a complete solution for managing structured data in a lightweight and efficient manner.
