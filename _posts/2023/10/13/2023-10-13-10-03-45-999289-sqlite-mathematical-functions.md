## Absolute Value

The `ABS()` function in SQLite is used to return the absolute value of a number. It takes a single argument and returns its positive value. For example:

```sql
SELECT ABS(-5); -- Output: 5
SELECT ABS(10); -- Output: 10
```

## Square Root

To find the square root of a number in SQLite, you can use the `SQRT()` function. It returns the square root of a given value. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT SQRT(25); -- Output: 5.0
SELECT SQRT(16); -- Output: 4.0
```

## Exponential Function

The `EXP()` function in SQLite is used to calculate the exponential value of a given number. It returns `e` raised to the power of the argument. Here's how you can use it:

```sql
SELECT EXP(2); -- Output: 7.38905609893065
SELECT EXP(0.5); -- Output: 1.64872127070013
```

## Trigonometric Functions

SQLite provides various trigonometric functions, such as `SIN()`, `COS()`, and `TAN()`, to perform trigonometric calculations. These functions take an angle in radians as input and return the corresponding trigonometric value. Here are some examples:

```sql
SELECT SIN(0); -- Output: 0.0
SELECT COS(0); -- Output: 1.0
SELECT TAN(0); -- Output: 0.0
```

## Ceiling and Floor

The `CEIL()` and `FLOOR()` functions in SQLite are used to round a number up or down, respectively. `CEIL()` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified value, while `FLOOR()` returns the largest integer less than or equal to it. Here's how you can use these functions:

```sql
SELECT CEIL(4.2); -- Output: 5
SELECT FLOOR(4.9); -- Output: 4
```

## Random Number Generation

SQLite provides the `RANDOM()` function, which generates a random floating-point value between 0 and 1. You can use this function to generate random numbers in your queries. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT RANDOM(); -- Output: Random decimal value between 0 and 1
```

## Conclusion

SQLite's mathematical functions offer powerful capabilities to perform calculations and manipulate numeric data within your SQL queries. Whether you need to find absolute values, calculate square roots, utilize trigonometric functions, round numbers, or generate random values, SQLite has you covered. Incorporate these functions into your code to enhance the mathematical capabilities of your SQLite database.
