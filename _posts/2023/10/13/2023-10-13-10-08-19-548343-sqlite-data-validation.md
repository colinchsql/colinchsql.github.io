SQLite is a lightweight and popular relational database management system that can be embedded into applications. When working with SQLite databases, it is important to ensure the validity and integrity of the data being stored. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques for data validation in SQLite.

## 1. Declaring Data Types

One way to validate data in SQLite is by properly declaring the data types for each column in the table schema. SQLite supports various data types such as INTEGER, TEXT, REAL, and BLOB. By assigning the appropriate data type to each column, you can prevent invalid data from being inserted or updated.

Here is an example of table creation with data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    salary REAL
);
```

In the above example, we have specified the data types for the `id`, `name`, `age`, and `salary` columns. Any attempt to insert data of a different type into these columns will result in an error.

## 2. Using Constraints

Constraints can be applied to SQLite tables to ensure data validation. SQLite supports various constraint types, including NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK.

Let's take a look at a couple of commonly used constraints:

### NOT NULL Constraint

The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```

In the above example, the `name` and `email` columns are declared with the NOT NULL constraint. Therefore, any attempt to insert a row without providing a value for these columns will result in an error.

### CHECK Constraint

The CHECK constraint allows you to define a condition that must be true for a row to be valid.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    total_amount REAL NOT NULL,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'cancelled'))
);
```

In the above example, the CHECK constraint is used to ensure that the `status` column can only have the values 'pending', 'completed', or 'cancelled'. Any attempt to insert a row with a different value for the `status` column will result in an error.

## 3. Using Triggers

Triggers can also be utilized for data validation in SQLite. Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed when a specific database event occurs, such as an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation.

Here is an example of a trigger that validates a condition before allowing an INSERT operation:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER validate_age
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (NEW.age < 18)
    BEGIN
        RAISE(ABORT, 'Employees must be at least 18 years old');
    END;
```

In the above example, the trigger `validate_age` is defined to execute before any insert operation on the `employees` table. If the condition specified in the WHEN clause (`NEW.age < 18`) evaluates to true, an exception is raised, preventing the insertion of the row.

## Conclusion

Validating data is essential to maintain the integrity and accuracy of SQLite databases. By using techniques such as declaring data types, applying constraints, and utilizing triggers, you can ensure that only valid and consistent data is stored in your SQLite database.

Remember to always consider the specific requirements of your application when selecting the appropriate data validation techniques.
