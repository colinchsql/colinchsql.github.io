Materialized views are widely used in databases to store pre-aggregated or pre-computed data, which helps to improve query performance in analytical workloads. To populate materialized views with data, one common approach is to use a tool called SQL Loader.

In this blog post, we will walk through the steps of loading data into materialized views using SQL Loader, which is a utility provided by Oracle Database for bulk loading data from external files into the database.

## Introduction to SQL Loader

SQL Loader is a command-line utility that allows you to load data from various file formats, such as CSV, tab-delimited, or even custom formats, into Oracle database tables. It provides a flexible and efficient way to load large volumes of data.

## Preparing Data Files

Before loading data into a materialized view, you need to prepare the data files in the required format. The data file should contain the data that needs to be inserted or updated in the materialized view.

Let's assume we have a CSV file named `data.csv` with the following data:

```
ID,Name,Amount
1,John Doe,100
2,Jane Smith,200
3,Michael Johnson,150
```

Save the data file in a suitable location accessible to the SQL Loader utility.

## Creating Control File

A control file is used to specify the format of the data file, the target table, and the mapping between source file columns and target table columns. It acts as a bridge between the data file and the database.

Create a control file named `load_data.ctl`, and specify the necessary details:

```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
APPEND
INTO TABLE materialized_view_table
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
(ID,
 Name,
 Amount)
```

In the above control file, we specify the input file (`INFILE`), the target table name (`materialized_view_table`), and the column mapping between the data file and the materialized view.

## Loading Data with SQL Loader

To load the data into the materialized view, we can use the following SQL Loader command:

```shell
sqlldr username/password@database control=load_data.ctl
```

Replace `username` and `password` with your Oracle database credentials, and `database` with the connection details.

By executing the command, SQL Loader reads the control file and the data file, then performs the necessary operations to load the data into the materialized view.

## Refreshing the Materialized View

After loading the data into the materialized view, you may need to refresh it to reflect the latest changes. Depending on your requirements, you can choose to manually refresh the materialized view or set up automatic refresh using Oracle's `REFRESH` command.

To manually refresh the materialized view, you can execute the following SQL statement:

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('materialized_view_name');
END;
```

Replace `materialized_view_name` with the name of your materialized view.

## Conclusion

Loading data into materialized views using SQL Loader is a convenient and efficient way to populate pre-aggregated data in Oracle databases. By following the steps we've discussed in this blog post, you can load data from external files into materialized views and improve query performance in your analytical workloads.

Remember to carefully prepare the data files, create the control file, and execute the SQL Loader command to load the data into the materialized view. Refreshing the materialized view ensures that it reflects the latest changes from the loaded data.
