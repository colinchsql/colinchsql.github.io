When loading data into a database table, it is important to ensure that the data being loaded adheres to certain constraints. One of the ways to enforce these constraints is by using check constraints. Check constraints enable you to define conditions that must be satisfied for data to be inserted or updated in a table.

In this article, we will explore how to load data into tables with check constraints using SQL Loader, a powerful command-line tool for bulk loading data into Oracle databases.

## Setting up Check Constraints

Before we can load data into a table, we need to define the check constraints that will validate the data. Check constraints are defined at the column level or table level and are used to ensure that the data meets specific conditions.

Let's consider an example where we have a "Customers" table with a column named "Age". We want to enforce a check constraint that ensures the age is between 18 and 100 years.

To create the check constraint, we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Age CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Age <= 100);
```

## Creating the Control File

After setting up the check constraint, we need to create a control file that specifies how SQL Loader should load the data. The control file defines the structure of the data file and maps it to the columns of the table.

Here's an example of a control file named `customer_loader.ctl`:

```plaintext
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'customer_data.csv'
BADFILE 'customer_data.bad'
DISCARDFILE 'customer_data.dsc'
APPEND
INTO TABLE Customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(
  ID,
  Name,
  Age
)
```

The control file specifies the data file (`customer_data.csv`) to be loaded, as well as the bad file and discard file to store any rejected or discarded records.

## Running SQL Loader

Once the control file is created, we can run SQL Loader to load the data into the table. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the control file and data file are located. Then, execute the following command:

```shell
sqlldr username/password@hostname control=customer_loader.ctl
```

Make sure to replace `username`, `password`, and `hostname` with your database credentials and hostname.

SQL Loader will read the data file according to the control file specifications and insert the records into the table, while applying the check constraints defined earlier. Any records that violate the check constraints will be rejected and stored in the bad file specified in the control file.

## Conclusion

Using SQL Loader, we can easily load data into tables with check constraints, ensuring that only valid data is inserted into the database. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can successfully load data while enforcing the specified constraints.

Remember to define the check constraints before loading the data and create a control file to map the data file's structure to the table columns. Running SQL Loader with the control file will initiate the data loading process, applying the check constraints and handling any rejected records.

Happy loading!
