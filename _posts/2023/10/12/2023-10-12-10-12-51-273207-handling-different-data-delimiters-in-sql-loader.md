When using SQL Loader to load data into an Oracle database, it is common to encounter files with different data delimiters, such as comma-separated values (CSV) or tab-separated values (TSV). Luckily, SQL Loader provides a flexible solution to handle these varying delimiters.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to configure SQL Loader to handle different data delimiters, ensuring successful data ingestion into the database.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
SQL Loader is a powerful tool provided by Oracle to load data from external files into an Oracle database. It supports a wide range of data file formats, and one of the key considerations when working with SQL Loader is handling different data delimiters.

Configuring SQL Loader for different data delimiters involves specifying the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY** clause in the control file. This clause tells SQL Loader which character(s) to use as the field delimiter in the input file.

Let's now explore how to configure SQL Loader for specific data delimiters.

## Configuring SQL Loader for Comma-Separated Values (CSV)<a name="csv"></a>
When dealing with CSV files, where fields are separated by commas, we need to set the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','** clause in the control file.

Consider the following example control file (`my_csv.ctl`) for loading data from a CSV file into the database:

```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
INTO TABLE my_table
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
TRAILING NULLCOLS
(
  col1,
  col2,
  col3
)
```

In this example, the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','** clause specifies that each field in the input file is separated by a comma. We then map the fields to the corresponding columns in the `my_table` table.

## Configuring SQL Loader for Tab-Separated Values (TSV)<a name="tsv"></a>
For TSV files, where fields are separated by tabs, we need to set the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'** clause in the control file.

Consider the following example control file (`my_tsv.ctl`) for loading data from a TSV file into the database:

```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.tsv'
INTO TABLE my_table
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
TRAILING NULLCOLS
(
  col1,
  col2,
  col3
)
```

In this example, the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'** clause specifies that each field in the input file is separated by a tab character. We then map the fields to the corresponding columns in the `my_table` table.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>
Handling different data delimiters in SQL Loader is a common requirement when loading data from external files into an Oracle database. By configuring the **FIELDS TERMINATED BY** clause in the control file, we can easily accommodate various delimiters such as commas or tabs.

In this blog post, we covered how to configure SQL Loader for both comma-separated values (CSV) and tab-separated values (TSV) files. By following these guidelines, you'll be able to successfully load data with different delimiters using SQL Loader.
