In data loading processes, it's common to encounter data inconsistencies or validation errors. These issues can arise due to human error, data corruption, or mismatched data formats. In SQL Loader, a powerful tool for loading data into an Oracle database, there are several approaches you can take to handle such inconsistencies and enforce data validation. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques to address these challenges.

## Data Inconsistencies
When loading data, it is crucial to handle inconsistencies effectively to maintain the integrity of the database. Let's explore a few techniques for dealing with data inconsistencies using SQL Loader.

### Skipping Rows with Errors
One approach is to skip rows with errors during the data loading process. By default, SQL Loader tries to load all rows, but you can instruct it to continue loading even if errors occur. This can be achieved using the `SKIP` clause in the control file.

For example:
```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
BADFILE 'data.bad'
DISCARDFILE 'data.dsc'
APPEND INTO TABLE employees
SKIP 5
```
In this example, the first 5 rows in the data file will be skipped, and the loading process will start from the 6th row. This can be useful if you have some known inconsistencies at the beginning of the data file.

### Rejecting Rows with ERRORS Clause
Another approach is to reject rows that contain errors. SQL Loader allows you to specify the `ERRORS` clause in the control file to set a maximum number of errors allowed during the data loading process.

For example:
```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
BADFILE 'data.bad'
DISCARDFILE 'data.dsc'
APPEND INTO TABLE employees
ERRORS 5
```
In this example, if more than 5 errors occur during the data loading process, SQL Loader will terminate the loading process and create a `.bad` file to store the rejected rows.

### Logging Error Rows
SQL Loader also provides a feature to log the rows that contain errors. By specifying the `LOG` clause in the control file, you can create a log file that captures the details of the error rows.

For example:
```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
BADFILE 'data.bad'
DISCARDFILE 'data.dsc'
LOG 'data.log'
APPEND INTO TABLE employees
```
In this example, a log file named `data.log` will be created, and it will contain the details of the rows that caused errors during the loading process.

## Data Validation
Data validation is an essential part of the data loading process. Let's explore two common techniques to enforce data validation using SQL Loader.

### Using WHEN Clause in Control File
The `WHEN` clause in the control file allows you to specify conditions for data validation. You can define conditions on specific columns and instruct SQL Loader to only load rows that meet these conditions.

For example:
```sql
LOAD DATA
INFILE 'data.csv'
BADFILE 'data.bad'
DISCARDFILE 'data.dsc'
APPEND INTO TABLE employees
WHEN (hire_date > sysdate)
```
In this example, only rows where the `hire_date` is greater than the current date will be loaded. Any rows that do not meet this condition will be discarded or stored in the `.bad` file.

### Defining Constraints in Database
Another approach is to define constraints directly in the database. By defining constraints such as primary key, unique key, or check constraints on the target table, you can ensure that only valid data is loaded.

For example:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT emp_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT emp_email_uk UNIQUE (email);
```
In this example, we add a primary key constraint on the `employee_id` column and a unique key constraint on the `email` column. SQL Loader will try to load the data, and any rows that violate these constraints will be rejected.

## Conclusion
When using SQL Loader for data loading, it is essential to handle data inconsistencies and enforce data validation to ensure the integrity and reliability of the loaded data. By utilizing techniques such as skipping rows with errors, rejecting rows, logging error rows, using the WHEN clause, and defining constraints in the database, you can effectively handle data inconsistencies and enforce data validation in SQL Loader.
