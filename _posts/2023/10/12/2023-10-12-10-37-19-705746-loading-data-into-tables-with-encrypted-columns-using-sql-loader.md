SQL Loader is a powerful tool that allows you to bulk load data from various sources into Oracle database tables. When dealing with sensitive data that needs to be encrypted, SQL Loader provides support for loading data into tables with encrypted columns. In this blog post, we will discuss how to achieve this using SQL Loader.

## Introduction to SQL Loader

SQL Loader is a command-line tool that allows you to load data from external files into Oracle database tables. It provides flexibility, performance, and error handling capabilities, making it a popular choice for bulk data loading.

## Encrypting columns in Oracle

Oracle provides various methods for encrypting data, including Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and column-level encryption using the DBMS_CRYPTO package. TDE is a feature that transparently encrypts data at the storage level, while column-level encryption allows you to selectively encrypt specific columns.

To encrypt a column using column-level encryption, you need to define the column as a SecureFile LOB type and specify the encryption algorithm and key. The encryption key can be stored in a hardware security module (HSM) or the Oracle Wallet.

## Preparing the data file

Before loading data into encrypted columns, you need to prepare the data file in the required format. Ensure that the data file contains the encrypted values or the plain text values that will be encrypted during the loading process.

## Creating the control file

The control file is a file that specifies the format of the data file and maps it to the corresponding columns in the database table. It also allows you to specify any transformations or validations that need to be performed on the data.

In the control file, you need to define the encrypted columns as `CHAR` or `VARCHAR2` types and specify the encryption algorithm and key. You can use the `ENCRYPT` keyword followed by the algorithm and key in the column definition.

## Loading data into encrypted columns

Once you have prepared the data file and created the control file, you can use the SQL Loader command-line utility to load the data into the encrypted columns. The command syntax will be similar to the standard SQL Loader command, with the additional specification of the control file.

```sql
sqlldr username/password control=control_file.ctl
```

## Conclusion

Loading data into tables with encrypted columns using SQL Loader provides a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data. By encrypting the columns and using SQL Loader to load the data, you can ensure that the data remains protected throughout the loading process.

In this blog post, we discussed the steps involved in loading data into encrypted columns using SQL Loader. We explored the process of encrypting columns in Oracle, preparing the data file, creating the control file, and loading the data into the encrypted columns.
