Duplicates are a common issue that database administrators often encounter during data loading or bulk data insertion operations. It is crucial to handle duplicates effectively to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the database. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle duplicate records during loading using SQL Loader.

## Introduction to SQL Loader
SQL Loader is a command-line tool provided by Oracle to load data from external files into Oracle database tables. It offers various features to efficiently load massive amounts of data quickly. However, by default, SQL Loader does not handle duplicate records automatically, and it depends on the database configuration to enforce uniqueness.

## Identifying Duplicate Records
Before we proceed with handling duplicate records, it is essential to identify them accurately. The duplicate records can be identified by one or more columns or a combination of columns that define uniqueness in a table. Typically, a primary key or a unique key constraint is used to enforce uniqueness in a table.

## Strategies to Handle Duplicates
Here are a few strategies to handle duplicate records during loading using SQL Loader:

### 1. Inserting Only Unique Records
One approach is to insert only the unique records and discard the duplicate ones. This can be achieved by enabling the `UNIQUE` option in the SQL Loader control file. SQL Loader will skip the duplicate records during the loading process.

### 2. Skipping Duplicate Records
Another strategy is to skip the duplicate records altogether without performing any insert operation. Using the `SKIP` option in the SQL Loader control file, duplicate records can be ignored during the loading process.

### 3. Handling Duplicate Records with Custom Logic
In some cases, you may want to handle duplicate records using custom logic. You can achieve this by using the `WHEN` clause in the SQL Loader control file. By specifying a condition, you can choose to insert/update/delete records based on your specific requirements.

## Example: Handling Duplicates with SQL Loader
Let's consider an example where we have a `customers` table with a unique constraint on the `email` column. We want to load a file containing customer data into the table while handling duplicate email records:

```sql
LOAD DATA 
INFILE 'customer_data.csv'
INTO TABLE customers
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
(
  name,
  email
)
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN 
  INSERT (name, email)
  VALUES (:name, :email)
```

In this example, the `WHEN NOT MATCHED` clause ensures that only unique email records are inserted into the `customers` table, and duplicate email records are skipped during the loading process.

## Conclusion
Handling duplicate records during loading is crucial to maintain data integrity in the database. SQL Loader provides several strategies to handle duplicates effectively. By choosing the appropriate approach based on your requirements, you can ensure that only unique records are inserted and duplicates are handled correctly.
