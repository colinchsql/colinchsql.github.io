SQL Loader is a powerful tool for loading data into an Oracle database. It offers a variety of configuration options and features to optimize data loading performance. In this article, we will explore some advanced performance tuning techniques for SQL Loader.

## 1. Use Direct Path Load

By default, SQL Loader uses a conventional path load method, which performs the loading process by inserting data through SQL INSERT statements. However, this method can be relatively slow for large datasets.

To improve performance, you can use the direct path load method. This method bypasses SQL processing and writes directly to database data files, resulting in faster loading times. To enable direct path load, use the `DIRECT` keyword when invoking SQL Loader:

```sql
sqlldr control=loader.ctl direct=true
```

## 2. Increase READSIZE and BINDSIZE

The `READSIZE` and `BINDSIZE` parameters control the size of data read from the input file and the size of bind arrays used for data insertion. Increasing these parameters can significantly improve performance.

For example, to increase the `READSIZE` and `BINDSIZE` to 1MB, use the following configuration in your SQL Loader control file:

```sql
OPTIONS (READSIZE=1048576, BINDSIZE=1048576)
```

Adjust the values according to your specific requirements and available system resources.

## 3. Use PARALLEL Load

When loading data into Oracle, you can take advantage of parallel processing to speed up the loading process. SQL Loader provides a `PARALLEL` parameter that allows you to specify the degree of parallelism for data loading.

By using multiple parallel processes, you can distribute the load across multiple CPUs and disks, resulting in faster data loading. To enable parallel loading, use the `PARALLEL` keyword in your SQL Loader command:

```sql
sqlldr control=loader.ctl parallel=true
```

You can also specify the degree of parallelism with the `PARALLEL` parameter:

```sql
sqlldr control=loader.ctl parallel=4
```

This example sets the degree of parallelism to four.

## 4. Use Direct-Path Writes

By default, SQL Loader uses conventional path writes, which perform single-block I/O for each write operation. This can result in inefficient disk access and slow performance.

To improve performance, you can enable direct-path writes by specifying the `DIRECT_PATH` parameter. This parameter enables SQL Loader to perform multi-block I/O, resulting in faster data loading.

```sql
OPTIONS (DIRECT_PATH=TRUE)
```

Keep in mind that direct-path writes require additional disk space for sorting and temporary storage.

## 5. Use the SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES Option

If your table has unusable indexes, SQL Loader attempts to load data with the indexes enabled by default. This can result in slower performance due to the overhead of updating indexes during the loading process.

To improve performance, you can use the `SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES` option to skip the loading of unusable indexes. This can significantly speed up the data loading process. Specify the option in your SQL Loader control file:

```sql
OPTIONS (SKIP_UNUSABLE_INDEXES=TRUE)
```

## Conclusion

SQL Loader provides various options and techniques to optimize data loading performance. By using direct path load, increasing read and bind sizes, enabling parallel loading, using direct-path writes, and skipping unusable indexes, you can significantly improve the performance of SQL Loader in handling large datasets. Experiment with these techniques and fine-tune them based on your specific requirements and system resources.

Remember that performance tuning should be done with careful consideration for the specific characteristics of your data and system. Keep monitoring and benchmarking the performance to identify further areas of improvement.
