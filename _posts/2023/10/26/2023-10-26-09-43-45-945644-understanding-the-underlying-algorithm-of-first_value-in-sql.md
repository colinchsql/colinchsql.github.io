In SQL, `FIRST_VALUE` is a window function that allows you to retrieve the first value in a group of rows based on a specified order. It is commonly used in analytical queries to find the first occurrence of a certain attribute within a partitioned dataset.

## Syntax
The syntax for using `FIRST_VALUE` is as follows:

```
FIRST_VALUE(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC])
```

The `expression` represents the column or expression from which the first value will be retrieved. The `PARTITION BY` clause is optional and allows you to define the partitioning of the dataset. The `ORDER BY` clause specifies the column that will determine the order of the rows within each partition.

## Algorithm
The algorithm behind `FIRST_VALUE` is relatively straightforward. It retrieves the value from the first row in the partitioned dataset that meets the specified order. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. The dataset is divided into partitions based on the `PARTITION BY` clause, if specified.
2. Within each partition, the rows are sorted based on the `ORDER BY` clause.
3. The value from the first row of each partition, according to the specified order, is returned.

It's important to note that `FIRST_VALUE` does not remove or filter out any rows from the dataset. Instead, it simply returns the value from the first row within each partition.

## Example Usage
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the usage of `FIRST_VALUE`. Suppose we have a table called `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`. We want to find the first and highest salary within each department.

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    name,
    salary,
    FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS first_salary
FROM
    employees;
```

In this example, we use `FIRST_VALUE` to retrieve the first salary for each department. By sorting the rows within each partition (`department`) in descending order based on salary, we can get the highest salary for each department as the first value.

## Conclusion
Understanding the underlying algorithm of `FIRST_VALUE` in SQL is crucial for leveraging its power in analytical queries. By partitioning and ordering the dataset, `FIRST_VALUE` enables us to retrieve the first value based on specific criteria. This function is invaluable in various data analysis scenarios, allowing for deeper insights and better decision-making.
