Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various domains like finance, sales, supply chain management, and more. SQL, being a powerful querying language, can be used to build simple forecast models. In this blog post, we will explore the application of the `FIRST_VALUE` function in time series forecasting models.

## What is FIRST_VALUE?

`FIRST_VALUE` is a window function in SQL that allows us to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of records within a specific window frame. It is often used in conjunction with the `OVER` clause to define the partitioning and ordering of the data.

## How can FIRST_VALUE be used in time series forecasting?

To demonstrate the use of `FIRST_VALUE` in time series forecasting, let's consider a fictional dataset containing monthly sales data. Our goal is to forecast future sales based on historical data.

### Step 1: Data preparation

We start by organizing our data in a table with columns like `date` and `sales`. The `date` column represents the time series, and the `sales` column contains the corresponding sales values.

### Step 2: Calculating the lagged values

In time series forecasting, lagged values of the target variable are often used as features in predictive models. We can calculate the lagged values using the `FIRST_VALUE` function. To compute the lagged values for the sales column, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  date,
  sales,
  FIRST_VALUE(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS lagged_sales
FROM 
  sales_data;
```

In this query, we select the `date` and `sales` columns from the `sales_data` table. We then use the `FIRST_VALUE` function with the `OVER` clause to get the first value of the `sales` column for the previous row within a window frame that includes the current row and its immediate previous row.

### Step 3: Forecasting using lagged values

Once we have the lagged values, we can utilize them as features in a forecasting model. There are various models available for time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet.

Here is an example SQL query using the `lagged_sales` column with the Prophet time series forecasting model:

```sql
SELECT 
  date,
  sales,
  lagged_sales,
  PROPHET(date, sales, lagged_sales) AS forecasted_sales
FROM 
  sales_data;
```

In this query, we select the `date`, `sales`, `lagged_sales`, and the predicted `forecasted_sales`. The Prophet function takes the `date`, `sales`, and `lagged_sales` columns as inputs and returns the forecasted sales values.

## Conclusion

The `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL is a valuable tool for time series forecasting models. It allows us to calculate the lagged values, which can be used as features in predictive models. By leveraging SQL's capabilities, we can easily implement simple forecasting models and gain insights from our time series data.
