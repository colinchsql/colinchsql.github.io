When working with time series data in SQL, efficient compression and storage methods are crucial for optimizing performance and reducing storage requirements. One method that can greatly help in this regard is using the `FIRST_VALUE` function.

## What is FIRST_VALUE?

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is a SQL window function that allows you to retrieve the first value in a specified column within a group of rows, based on a defined window frame. It is a powerful tool for working with time series data, as it enables efficient compression and storage.

## Benefits of using FIRST_VALUE for time series compression and storage

### 1. Reduced storage requirements

Time series data often contains multiple rows with similar values for a given time interval. By using the `FIRST_VALUE` function, you can retrieve the first value within each interval and store it, eliminating the need to store redundant values. This compression technique significantly reduces the storage requirements for storing time series data.

### 2. Fast retrieval of compressed data

Since the `FIRST_VALUE` function retrieves only the first value within each interval, retrieving compressed time series data becomes faster compared to storing and querying every individual data point. This is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets or for real-time data analysis scenarios.

### Example:

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the benefits of using `FIRST_VALUE` for time series compression and storage. Suppose we have a table named `sensor_data` with the following columns - `timestamp` and `value`, representing the timestamp of data and its corresponding value.

```sql
SELECT timestamp, FIRST_VALUE(value) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS compressed_value
FROM sensor_data
```
This query retrieves the compressed time series data by using the `FIRST_VALUE` function and ordering the data by timestamp. Only the first value within each interval is stored as `compressed_value`, resulting in a reduced storage size.

By implementing this compression technique, you can efficiently store and retrieve time series data in SQL, optimizing storage requirements and improving query performance.
