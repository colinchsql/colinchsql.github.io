Data analysis is a crucial aspect of working with databases. Sometimes, we need to examine the distribution of data within a dataset to gain insights and make informed decisions. In SQL, we can utilize the `FIRST_VALUE` function to analyze the data distribution.

## Understanding the FIRST_VALUE function

The `FIRST_VALUE` function is used to return the value of a specified expression, based on the ordering specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. It is a window function that provides access to multiple rows within a query result set.

The syntax of the `FIRST_VALUE` function is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC]
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS alias_name
```

## Analyzing data distribution

To analyze the distribution of data in a dataset, we can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function along with the `COUNT` function. Let's assume we have a table called `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary`.

To determine the highest and lowest salaries in the dataset, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    FIRST_VALUE(first_name) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_paid_employee,
    FIRST_VALUE(last_name) OVER (ORDER BY salary ASC) AS lowest_paid_employee
FROM
    employees
```

In this query, we use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the `first_name` of the employee with the highest salary (`ORDER BY salary DESC`) and the `last_name` of the employee with the lowest salary (`ORDER BY salary ASC`).

## Conclusion

Analyzing data distribution is an essential aspect of data analysis. The `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL allows us to retrieve specific values based on the ordering of a dataset. By using this function, we can gain insights into the distribution of data within a table.
