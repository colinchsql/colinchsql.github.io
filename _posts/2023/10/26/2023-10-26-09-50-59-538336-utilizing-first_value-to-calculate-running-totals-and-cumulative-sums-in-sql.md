When working with SQL, there are often cases where we need to calculate running totals or cumulative sums of certain values over a sequence of rows. One useful function that can help achieve this is `FIRST_VALUE`.

`FIRST_VALUE` is an analytic function in SQL that allows us to retrieve the first value in an ordered partition of rows. By utilizing this function along with window functions, we can effectively calculate running totals and cumulative sums in SQL queries.

To demonstrate how to use `FIRST_VALUE` for calculating running totals, let's assume we have a table called `sales` with the following columns: `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, and `amount`.

```sql
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_id) AS running_total
FROM
  sales;
```

In the above query, we are selecting the `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `amount` columns from the `sales` table. We then use the `SUM` function along with the `OVER` clause to calculate the running total of the `amount` column. The `ORDER BY` clause determines the order in which the running total calculation is performed.

Similarly, we can use `FIRST_VALUE` to calculate cumulative sums in SQL. Let's modify our previous query to include cumulative sums instead of running totals.

```sql
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_id) AS running_total,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_sum
FROM
  sales;
```

In the updated query, we add another column `cumulative_sum` which uses the `SUM` function along with the `OVER` clause. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` specifies that we want the cumulative sum from the start of the ordered partition to the current row.

With the help of `FIRST_VALUE` and window functions, we can easily calculate running totals and cumulative sums in SQL. This is particularly useful when analyzing time-series data or when dealing with any data that requires aggregating values over a sequence of rows.

By understanding and utilizing these SQL functions effectively, we can perform advanced calculations and analysis on our data with ease.
