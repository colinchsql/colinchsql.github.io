Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many domains, including finance, supply chain, and sales. Traditional approaches often rely on statistical models or machine learning algorithms. In some cases, incorporating SQL-based queries with machine learning can provide more flexibility and scalability. One useful SQL function for time series modeling is `FIRST_VALUE`, which allows us to access the first value within a group.

In this blog post, we will explore how to incorporate `FIRST_VALUE` in SQL-based time series forecasting models with machine learning. We will use the example of predicting daily sales based on historical data. Let's get started!

## Understanding the FIRST_VALUE Function

In SQL, the `FIRST_VALUE` function allows us to retrieve the first value of a specified column within a group. This is especially useful in time series analysis, where we often need to access the initial value within a time sequence.

The syntax for using `FIRST_VALUE` is as follows:

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(column) OVER (PARTITION BY group_column ORDER BY order_column ASC)
```

Here, `column` represents the column from which we want to retrieve the first value. `group_column` specifies the grouping criteria, and `order_column` determines the order in which the values are sorted within each group.

## Preparing the Data

Before incorporating `FIRST_VALUE` in our model, we need to prepare the data. In our example, let's assume we have a table named `sales_data` with columns `date`, `product_id`, and `daily_sales`.

We can aggregate the daily sales data using the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    date,
    FIRST_VALUE(daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date ASC) AS initial_sales,
    SUM(daily_sales) AS total_sales
FROM
    sales_data
GROUP BY
    date, product_id
```

This query retrieves the initial sales value for each product and calculates the total sales for each date.

## Creating a SQL Model with Machine Learning

Now that we have prepared the data, we can create a SQL-based model that incorporates machine learning. This allows us to leverage the power of both SQL queries and machine learning algorithms.

To create a model, we can use SQL extensions like `CREATE MODEL` in Google BigQuery or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` in PostgreSQL. We can then train the model on the aggregated sales data.

```sql
CREATE MODEL sales_forecast
OPTIONS (model_type='linear_regression') AS
SELECT
    initial_sales,
    total_sales
FROM
    aggregated_sales_data
```

In this example, we use a linear regression model to predict the total sales based on the initial sales value. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, we can choose different algorithms or models.

## Incorporating FIRST_VALUE for Time Series Forecasting

Once the model is trained, we can use it for time series forecasting. This is where the `FIRST_VALUE` function becomes valuable.

Let's say we want to predict the sales for the next seven days. We can use the `FIRST_VALUE` function to retrieve the initial sales value for the most recent date and then apply the machine learning model to generate the forecast.

```sql
WITH
    recent_sales AS (
        SELECT
            product_id,
            FIRST_VALUE(daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date DESC) AS initial_sales
        FROM
            sales_data
        WHERE
            date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM sales_data)
    )
SELECT
    product_id,
    initial_sales,
    PREDICT(total_sales) AS forecasted_sales
FROM
    recent_sales, sales_forecast
```

In this query, we create a CTE (Common Table Expression) named `recent_sales` to retrieve the initial sales value for the most recent date. We then join this CTE with our trained model to predict the sales for the next seven days.

## Conclusion

Incorporating the `FIRST_VALUE` function in SQL-based time series forecasting models with machine learning can provide additional insights and flexibility. By leveraging the features of both SQL and machine learning, we can analyze historical data, create models, and generate forecasts all within a single SQL query.

In this blog post, we explored the usage of `FIRST_VALUE` in a time series forecasting scenario. However, there are various other SQL functions and machine learning techniques that can be combined to enhance our models further. Experimenting with different approaches can lead to more accurate predictions and better decision-making.

Happy forecasting! ðŸ“ˆ
