SQL Injection is a common vulnerability that occurs when attackers manipulate user input to execute malicious SQL statements. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and even complete database compromise. One effective way to prevent SQL injection is by using parameterized queries. In this article, we will explore how parameterized queries work and why they are important in securing your application.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a query. This is often achieved by manipulating user input fields such as login forms or search boxes. When the application does not properly validate or sanitize the input, it can be directly concatenated into the SQL statement and executed by the database.

Consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```python
username = request.GET['username']
password = request.GET['password']

sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
cursor.execute(sql)
```

In this example, if the user enters `' OR 1=1 --` as the username and password, the resulting SQL query becomes:


```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = ''
```

This query will effectively bypass the authentication logic and return all records from the `users` table.

## What are Parameterized Queries?

Parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements, are a feature provided by most database APIs that enable the separation of SQL code from the user input. Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL statement, we use placeholders or parameters that are later bound to the actual values at the time of execution.

Let's modify the vulnerable code snippet to use parameterized queries:

```python
username = request.GET['username']
password = request.GET['password']

sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s"
cursor.execute(sql, (username, password))
```

In this updated code, `%s` is a placeholder that represents the username and password in the SQL statement. The actual values are passed as parameters to the `execute` method, which takes care of proper escaping and quotation.

By utilizing parameterized queries, the database treats the input as data rather than executable SQL code. This prevents any attempts to inject additional SQL statements and ensures the input is handled safely and securely.

## Advantages of Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries offer several advantages over dynamically created SQL queries:

1. **Protection Against SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries automatically handle escaping and sanitization of input values, protecting your application from SQL injection attacks.

2. **Improved Performance**: Parameterized queries are typically compiled and cached by the database server, allowing for faster execution when the same query is used multiple times.

3. **Code Reusability**: By separating the SQL code from the input values, parameterized queries promote code reusability as the same query can be executed with different parameters.

4. **SQL Syntax Simplicity**: Parameterized queries eliminate the need for manual string concatenation, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

## Conclusion

SQL Injection is a serious security vulnerability that can have severe consequences for your application. By using parameterized queries, you can effectively prevent SQL injection attacks by separating user input from the SQL code. Parameterized queries offer increased security, improved performance, code reusability, and easier maintenance. Make sure to implement parameterized queries as a best practice to safeguard your application and its data.
