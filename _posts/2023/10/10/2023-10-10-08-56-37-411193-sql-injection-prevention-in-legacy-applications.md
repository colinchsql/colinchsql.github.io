SQL injection is a common security vulnerability that can be exploited to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data in an application. While it is best to prevent SQL injection from the design phase itself, there are still steps you can take to protect legacy applications from such attacks. This blog post will discuss some effective techniques to prevent SQL injection in legacy applications.

## What is SQL Injection? {#what-is-sql-injection}
SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate user input in such a way that it alters the intended SQL query executed by the application. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even complete system compromise.

## Identification {#identification}
The first step in preventing SQL injection is to identify vulnerable parts of the legacy application. Search for sections of code that construct dynamic SQL queries by concatenating user input. Common vulnerable points include login forms, search functionalities, and user input fields.

## Parameterized Queries {#parameterized-queries}
One effective technique for preventing SQL injection is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query, placeholders are used. These placeholders are then bound with user-supplied values, ensuring that the input is treated as data rather than executable SQL code.

Using parameterized queries not only eliminates the risk of SQL injection but also improves performance by allowing the database to cache query execution plans.

```python
import sqlite3

# Example of using parameterized queries in Python (SQLite)
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Using a placeholder '?'
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
```

## Input Validation {#input-validation}
Implement strict input validation to ensure that user-supplied data adheres to the expected format. Validate the input against predefined rules such as length, character type, and expected value range. By validating and sanitizing user input, you can prevent the execution of malicious SQL statements.

## Stored Procedures {#stored-procedures}
If your legacy application supports stored procedures, consider using them as an additional defense against SQL injection. Stored procedures encapsulate SQL code and can limit the manipulation of user input. They also provide better code organization and reusability.

## Web Application Firewalls {#web-application-firewalls}
Using web application firewalls (WAFs) can provide an extra layer of protection against SQL injection attacks. WAFs can inspect incoming requests and block those that contain suspicious or malicious patterns. Depending on the specific WAF implementation, it can detect and prevent many types of attacks, including SQL injection.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
While preventing SQL injection in legacy applications can be challenging, it is crucial to address this security vulnerability. By identifying vulnerable sections, using parameterized queries, implementing input validation, leveraging stored procedures, and considering the use of web application firewalls, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.

Remember, securing your legacy applications is an ongoing process, and regular security audits are recommended to ensure their protection against the evolving threat landscape.
