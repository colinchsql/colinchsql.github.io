SQL injection is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate a website's database by injecting malicious SQL statements. By exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, hackers can bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify or delete database records, and even gain unauthorized control over the entire system.

In this blog post, we will explore some of the techniques used by hackers to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities and learn how you can protect your web applications against these attacks.

## 1. Union-Based SQL Injection

Union-based SQL injection is one of the most common techniques used by hackers to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. This technique involves exploiting the `UNION` SQL operator to combine the resultsets of two or more SQL queries into a single resultset. By injecting malicious SQL code into a vulnerable parameter, hackers can retrieve data from other tables in the database that were not intended to be accessible.

For example, consider the following vulnerable SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<username>' AND password = '<password>'
```

An attacker can inject the following payload to retrieve all usernames and passwords from the `users` table:

```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
```

## 2. Error-Based SQL Injection

Error-based SQL injection is another common technique used by hackers to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. This technique leverages error messages generated by the database server to extract information about the database structure and contents.

By injecting SQL code that causes a database error, an attacker can obtain valuable information such as table and column names, database version, and even the contents of certain fields.

For example, consider the following vulnerable SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '<id>'
```

An attacker can inject the following payload to extract the table name and column names:

```sql
' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns --
```

## 3. Blind SQL Injection

Blind SQL injection is a technique used by hackers to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities when the application does not display database error messages. In blind SQL injection, hackers use boolean-based or time-based techniques to infer the existence or truth of certain conditions based on the application's response.

An attacker can construct payload that, when executed, will return a true or false response depending on the injected condition. By iteratively probing the database using these payloads, hackers can gather information about the database structure and contents.

For example, consider the following vulnerable SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '<id>'
```

An attacker can use the following payload to infer the existence of an admin user:

```sql
' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND substr(password, 1, 1) = 'a') = 1 --
```

## Protecting against SQL Injection Attacks

To protect your web applications against SQL injection attacks, consider implementing the following defensive measures:

- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to sanitize user input and prevent SQL injection.
- Input validation and proper data sanitization techniques should be employed to ensure that only valid and expected data is accepted.
- Implement least privilege principle and restrict database user privileges to minimize the potential impact of SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly update and patch your web application frameworks and libraries to address any known vulnerabilities.
- Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

By adopting these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities and defend your web applications against malicious attacks.
