As a developer, one of your top priorities should be ensuring the security of your applications. SQL Injection is a common vulnerability that attackers exploit to gain unauthorized access to your database-driven applications. In this blog post, we will explore what SQL Injection is and how you can prevent it in your custom database-driven applications.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate the input of a database-driven application to execute arbitrary SQL commands. It happens when the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries.

Consider the following example:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'
```

If the application does not validate or sanitize the `$username` and `$password` inputs, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code and manipulate the query.

For example, an attacker can input `' OR '1'='1'--` as the username and any password to bypass the authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.

## Preventing SQL Injection

To avoid SQL Injection vulnerabilities in your custom database-driven applications, you should follow these best practices:

### Use Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) are a way to execute SQL statements with placeholders for parameters. You provide the query template once, and then bind the values securely to the placeholders, preventing any chance of SQL injection.

Example in PHP using PDO:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password');
$stmt->execute(['username' => $username, 'password' => $password]);
```

By using parameterized queries, the database engine handles the proper escaping and quoting of the parameters, ensuring the query's integrity.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Ensure that the input adheres to the expected format, type, and length. Use input validation techniques like regular expressions and input field restrictions.

Additionally, sanitize the input by removing or escaping characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands. Be cautious of special characters such as single quotes, double quotes, and semicolons.

### Least Privilege Principle

Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring your database server. Grant the application's database user the minimum necessary permissions required to perform its intended operations. This way, even if an attacker manages to inject malicious SQL code, the potential damage will be limited.

## Conclusion

SQL Injection is a significant security risk for any custom database-driven application. By following best practices, such as using parameterized queries, validating and sanitizing user input, and implementing the least privilege principle, you can greatly reduce the likelihood of an SQL Injection vulnerability in your applications.

Remember, security is an ongoing process, and staying vigilant against emerging security threats is crucial. By combining preventive measures with regular security audits and testing, you can keep your applications secure from SQL Injection attacks.
