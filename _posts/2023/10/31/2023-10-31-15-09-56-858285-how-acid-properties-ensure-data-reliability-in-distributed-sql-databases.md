## Introduction

In distributed SQL databases, ensuring data reliability is a critical aspect of maintaining the integrity of the system. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties play a vital role in achieving this goal. These properties help to guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably, even in a distributed environment. In this blog post, we will delve into how ACID properties ensure data reliability in distributed SQL databases.

## Atomicity

Atomicity refers to the concept that a transaction must be treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. In distributed SQL databases, this means that either all the changes made by a transaction are successfully committed, or none of them are. ACID-compliant distributed databases use mechanisms like distributed locking and two-phase commit protocols to ensure atomicity. These mechanisms ensure that all nodes involved in a transaction agree on its outcome before committing or aborting.

## Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. In distributed SQL databases, enforcing consistency requires strict adherence to the defined schema and constraints. ACID-compliant distributed databases use distributed transactions and distributed locking to maintain consistency across nodes. The distributed transaction coordinator ensures that all participating nodes follow the same set of rules and constraints, guaranteeing data consistency.

## Isolation

Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, even when executed simultaneously. In a distributed SQL database, achieving isolation across different nodes is a significant challenge. ACID-compliant distributed databases implement isolation levels such as Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable using techniques like multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and distributed locking. These mechanisms prevent conflicts and ensure that each transaction is isolated and executed independently.

## Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are persistent and will survive system failures and restarts. In distributed SQL databases, durability is achieved by writing transactional log entries to disk or replicated storage across multiple nodes. ACID-compliant distributed databases also use techniques such as write-ahead logging (WAL) and distributed replication to ensure that committed data is safely stored and can be recovered in the event of failures.

## Conclusion

ACID properties play a crucial role in ensuring data reliability in distributed SQL databases. By guaranteeing atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, these properties provide the necessary assurances for reliable transaction processing. Distributed SQL databases leverage various mechanisms such as distributed locking, distributed transactions, MVCC, and replication to uphold these properties in a distributed environment. With ACID compliance, businesses can confidently rely on the integrity and reliability of the data stored in their distributed SQL databases.
