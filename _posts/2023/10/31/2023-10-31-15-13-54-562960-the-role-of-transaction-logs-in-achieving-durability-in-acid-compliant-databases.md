When it comes to databases, durability is a critical aspect to ensure data consistency and reliability. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance is a fundamental requirement in many database systems. In this blog post, we will explore the role of transaction logs in achieving durability in ACID-compliant databases.

## What is Durability? {#what-is-durability}
Durability, in the context of databases, refers to the ability of a system to guarantee that once a transaction is committed, its effects will persist even in the event of power outages, system crashes, or other failures. It ensures that the committed data will not be lost and can be recovered in case of any failures.

## ACID Compliance and Durability {#acid-compliance-and-durability}
ACID compliance is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. Durability is one of the key properties of ACID, alongside atomicity, consistency, and isolation. ACID-compliant databases ensure that transactions are durable by using various mechanisms, including transaction logs.

## Understanding Transaction Logs {#understanding-transaction-logs}
A transaction log, also known as a redo log or write-ahead log, is a sequential record of all modifications made to a database. It stores the sequence of changes in a way that allows for recovery in case of failures. The log records the actions performed by each transaction, such as insertions, updates, and deletions, in a structured manner.

## How Transaction Logs Ensure Durability {#how-transaction-logs-ensure-durability}
Transaction logs play a crucial role in achieving durability in ACID-compliant databases. Whenever a transaction modifies the database, the changes are first written to the transaction log before being applied to the actual database files. This ensures that the transaction's modifications are safely stored even if the database itself is not updated immediately.

In the event of a failure, such as a system crash or power outage, the transaction log can be used to recover the database to a consistent state. By replaying the logged transactions, the database system can reapply the changes that were recorded in the log but not yet reflected in the database files. This process restores the database to its last consistent state, ensuring durability.

## Recovering from Failures {#recovering-from-failures}
When a failure occurs, the database system checks the integrity of the transaction log and determines which transactions were committed but not yet applied to the database. It replays these transactions from the log to restore the database's state. Once the recovery process is complete, the database can continue processing transactions from where it left off before the failure.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
Transaction logs are an essential component of achieving durability in ACID-compliant databases. By storing all the modifications made to the database in a structured log, databases can recover from failures and ensure data consistency and reliability. Understanding the role of transaction logs helps us appreciate the mechanisms that make ACID compliance possible.
