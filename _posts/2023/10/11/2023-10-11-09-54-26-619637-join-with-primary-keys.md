In SQL, the JOIN operation allows you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. When joining tables, it is common to use primary keys to establish the relationship between the tables.

A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that there are no duplicate values in the column(s) and is used to establish referential integrity.

To perform a JOIN operation using primary keys, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.primary_key = table2.primary_key;
```

Let's say we have two tables: `users` and `orders`. The `users` table has a primary key column called `user_id`, and the `orders` table has a primary key column called `order_id`. We want to retrieve the user information along with their orders.

Here's how the JOIN operation with primary keys can be applied:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.user_id = orders.user_id;
```

In the above example, `users.user_id` refers to the primary key column in the `users` table, and `orders.user_id` refers to the primary key column in the `orders` table. By joining these two tables on their primary key columns, we can fetch the relevant data from both tables.

It's important to note that when performing JOIN operations, both tables must have a relationship based on their primary key column(s). This ensures that the correct rows are matched and combined.

By using primary keys in JOIN operations, you can efficiently retrieve data from multiple tables based on their shared relationships. This allows you to access related information and create more complex queries that span across different tables in a database.
