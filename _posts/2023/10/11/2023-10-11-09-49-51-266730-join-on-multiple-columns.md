To join tables using multiple columns, you can use the following syntax in SQL:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.columnA = table2.columnX
AND table1.columnB = table2.columnY;
```

In this example, `table1` and `table2` are the names of the tables you want to join. `columnA` and `columnB` are the columns in `table1`, while `columnX` and `columnY` are the corresponding columns in `table2`.

By using the `AND` operator, you can specify multiple conditions for the join to occur. This means that both conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result set.

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate the concept. Suppose we have two tables: `customers` and `orders`. The `customers` table has columns for `customer_id` and `customer_name`, while the `orders` table has columns for `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_date`.

To retrieve a list of orders along with the corresponding customer names, you can perform a join on both the `customer_id` and `order_id` columns as follows:

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
FROM orders
JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
AND orders.order_id = customers.order_id;
```

By specifying the multiple conditions in the `ON` clause, this query will match the `customer_id` and `order_id` values in both tables, returning the desired result set.

Using JOIN ON multiple columns provides great flexibility in retrieving data when there are complex relationships between tables. It allows you to define more precise conditions for joining tables and can be a valuable tool in managing and analyzing your database records.
