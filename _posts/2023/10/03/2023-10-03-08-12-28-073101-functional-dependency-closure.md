In the world of database management, functional dependencies play a crucial role in determining how data is structured and organized. The concept of functional dependency closure helps us understand the complete set of functional dependencies that can be derived from a given set of functional dependencies.

Functional dependencies express relationships between attributes in a database table. In simple terms, a functional dependency states that the value of one or more attributes determines the value of another attribute in the same table.

To find the functional dependency closure, we follow a step-by-step process known as Armstrong's axioms:

1. **Reflexivity**: For every attribute or set of attributes A, if B is a subset of A, then A → B holds. This means that every attribute or set of attributes determines itself.

2. **Augmentation**: If A → B holds, then A union C → B union C also holds. This means that we can add attributes to both sides of a functional dependency.

3. **Transitivity**: If A → B and B → C hold, then A → C also holds. This means that if we can derive a functional dependency indirectly, we can also derive it directly.

These axioms form the foundation for finding the closure of functional dependencies. By applying these rules iteratively, we can derive all the additional functional dependencies that can be inferred from the given set.

Let's take an example to illustrate the process:

Given the functional dependencies:
```
A → B
B → C
```

To find the closure, we start with the given functional dependencies and apply Armstrong's axioms:

1. Applying reflexivity: Since A is a subset of A, we have A → A.
2. Applying augmentation: From A → B, we can derive A → BC.
3. Applying transitivity: From A → BC and B → C, we can derive A → C.

The final functional dependency closure is:
```
A → A
A → B
A → C
B → C
```

By finding the functional dependency closure, we ensure that we have a complete and consistent set of functional dependencies. This helps us understand the data dependencies within a database table, which is essential for designing efficient and normalized databases.
