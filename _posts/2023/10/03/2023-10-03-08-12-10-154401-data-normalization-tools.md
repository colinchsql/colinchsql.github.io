1. Stitch (#data #normalization)
Stitch is a powerful data integration platform that offers built-in data normalization capabilities. It allows you to connect to various data sources, such as databases, SaaS applications, and cloud storage services, and normalize data from these disparate sources into a unified schema. With its intuitive interface, you can easily define transformation rules, mapping fields, and resolving data conflicts. Stitch also provides monitoring and logging features to ensure the accuracy and consistency of your normalized data.

To normalize data using Stitch:
```
SELECT 
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  UPPER(email) AS normalized_email,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(order_amount) AS total_order_amount
FROM
  orders
GROUP BY
  full_name,
  normalized_email,
  month
```

2. Talend (#dataintegration #normalization)
Talend is a comprehensive data integration and management platform that offers a range of tools for data normalization. With its drag-and-drop interface and extensive library of connectors, Talend enables you to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into a normalized structure. Talend's data mapping and transformation capabilities allow you to define complex normalization rules and handle data inconsistencies effectively. Additionally, it provides features like data lineage and data quality checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of normalized data.

To normalize data using Talend:
```
tMap_1 --> Normalize --> tHMap_1 --> tOutputFileDelimited_1
```
In the above example, tMap is used to define transformation rules, Normalize is used to normalize data based on the defined rules, tHMap is used for complex mapping, and tOutputFileDelimited is used to output the normalized data.

In conclusion, using data normalization tools like Stitch and Talend can greatly simplify the process of organizing and structuring data. These tools provide a wide range of features and functionalities to streamline the data normalization process and ensure data integrity. By utilizing these tools, businesses can effectively manage their data and derive meaningful insights from it.
