In a database management system, a tablespace is a logical storage container that holds tables, indexes, and other database objects. Monitoring and managing the growth and usage of tablespaces is essential for maintaining the performance and stability of a database. In this blog post, we will explore how to query tablespace statistics in SQL.

## Connecting to the Database

Before we can query tablespace statistics, we need to establish a connection to the database. Assuming you have the necessary credentials, here is an example of connecting to an Oracle database using SQL*Plus:

```sql
sqlplus username/password@hostname:port/service_name
```

Replace `username` and `password` with your database credentials, `hostname` and `port` with the appropriate values, and `service_name` with the name of the service you want to connect to.

## Querying Tablespace Statistics

Once connected to the database, we can query tablespace statistics using SQL queries. Here are a few common queries you can use to gather information about tablespaces:

## 1. Get Tablespace Usage

To retrieve information about the current usage of tablespaces, you can query the `DBA_TABLESPACE_USAGE_METRICS` view. This view provides statistics on allocated and used space for each tablespace.

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, used_percent
FROM dba_tablespace_usage_metrics;
```

## 2. Get Tablespace Size

To get the size of tablespaces in the database, you can query the `DBA_TABLESPACES` view, which contains information about all the tablespaces.

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, bytes
FROM dba_tablespaces;
```

## 3. Get Tablespace Free Space

To determine how much free space is available in each tablespace, you can subtract the used space from the total allocated space. Use the `DBA_FREE_SPACE` view to obtain information about the free space in the tablespaces.

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, sum(bytes/1024/1024) free_space_mb
FROM dba_free_space group by tablespace_name;
```

## Summary

In this blog post, we discussed how to query tablespace statistics in SQL. By monitoring and managing tablespace usage, you can ensure optimal performance and prevent issues related to space constraints. Remember to regularly check tablespace statistics and take appropriate actions based on the information obtained.
