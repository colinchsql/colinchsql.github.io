## Method 1: Using SQL queries
One way to monitor tablespace growth is by executing SQL queries against the database. The following query can be used to fetch information about tablespace sizes:

```sql
SELECT 
    tablespace_name,
    SUM(bytes) / 1024 / 1024 AS total_size_mb,
    SUM(bytes - NVL(free_space, 0)) / 1024 / 1024 AS used_size_mb,
    NVL(free_space, 0) / 1024 / 1024 AS free_space_mb
FROM 
    (
    SELECT 
        tablespace_name,
        SUM(bytes) AS bytes
    FROM 
        dba_data_files
    GROUP BY 
        tablespace_name
    ) t1
LEFT JOIN 
    (
    SELECT 
        tablespace_name,
        SUM(bytes) AS free_space
    FROM 
        dba_free_space
    GROUP BY 
        tablespace_name
    ) t2
ON 
    t1.tablespace_name = t2.tablespace_name
GROUP BY 
    tablespace_name, 
    free_space
```

This query retrieves the tablespace name, total size, used size, and free space for each tablespace in the database. Running this query periodically and analyzing the results will provide insights into tablespace growth trends.

## Method 2: Using database management tools
Most modern database management systems (DBMS) provide graphical tools to monitor database health, including tablespace growth. These tools often offer intuitive dashboards that display tablespace statistics, growth trends, and space allocation.

One popular tool is Oracle Enterprise Manager for Oracle databases, which provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities, including monitoring tablespace growth. Other database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server also offer their respective management tools.

Using such tools simplifies tablespace monitoring by providing real-time insights, alerts, and customizable reports. These tools also offer features like automated space allocation, resizing, and fragmentation analysis, ensuring efficient space management.

## Conclusion
Monitoring tablespace growth trends is crucial for maintaining database performance and avoiding space-related issues. Using SQL queries or database management tools, you can regularly check tablespace sizes, identify growth patterns, and take appropriate actions to optimize space utilization.

By keeping track of tablespace growth and proactively managing storage, you can ensure smooth database operations and prevent any potential disruptions caused by space constraints.
