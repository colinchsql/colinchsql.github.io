In a distributed database environment, sharding is a common technique employed to improve scalability and performance. Sharding involves dividing a database into multiple shards, where each shard contains a subset of the data. As a result, each shard can be stored and processed independently. However, when working with sharded SQL databases, denormalization becomes an important consideration.

## What is Denormalization?

Denormalization is the process of combining multiple database tables into one to improve read performance by reducing the number of joins required. It involves duplicating and storing data redundantly to avoid complex join operations. In sharded databases, denormalization helps to minimize cross-shard queries and increase query performance.

## Denormalization Strategies

### 1. Embedding Data

One denormalization strategy is to embed related data directly into the same table. By doing this, you eliminate the need for joins between tables when querying for related data. This reduces the complexity of queries and improves performance. However, it comes at the cost of increased storage space, as data duplication occurs.

For example, if your database schema has a "users" table and a "orders" table, you can denormalize the data by embedding the relevant order information directly into the users table. This way, all the necessary information for a user and their associated orders is stored in a single row.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    orders_json JSONB
);
```
### 2. Materialized Views

Another denormalization strategy is the use of materialized views. Materialized views are precomputed and stored versions of views that can be used to answer specific queries. They provide a way to store complex join queries as a new table, reducing the need for expensive join operations during query execution.

In a sharded database, you can create materialized views that combine data from multiple shards into a single table. This allows you to query for aggregated or related data without needing to access multiple shards.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW combined_orders AS
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;
```

## Conclusion

Denormalization strategies are crucial when working with sharded SQL databases. By embedding data or utilizing materialized views, you can reduce the complexity of queries and improve performance. However, it's important to strike a balance between denormalization and data consistency, as denormalization can lead to data redundancy and synchronization challenges.
