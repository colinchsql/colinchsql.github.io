In SQL, a tablespace is a logical storage area where database objects like tables, indexes, and views are stored. When creating database objects, you have the option to specify a tablespace where they will belong. If no tablespace is specified, the object will be created in the default tablespace.

The default tablespace is set at the database level and determines where new database objects will be created if no tablespace is specified explicitly. In this blog post, we will explore default tablespaces in SQL and how to manage them.

## Viewing the Default Tablespace

To view the current default tablespace, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT property_value
FROM database_properties
WHERE property_name = 'DEFAULT_PERMANENT_TABLESPACE';
```

If you are using Oracle Database, the query would be slightly different:

```sql
SELECT property_value
FROM database_properties
WHERE property_name = 'DEFAULT_TABLESPACE';
```

## Changing the Default Tablespace

To change the default tablespace, you need to use the `ALTER DATABASE` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE
SET DEFAULT TABLESPACE new_tablespace;
```

Replace `new_tablespace` with the name of the desired tablespace. Note that you need the necessary privileges to perform this operation.

## Considerations for Default Tablespaces

When choosing a default tablespace, consider the following points:

- Choose a default tablespace that has sufficient storage capacity for your database objects.
- It is recommended to have different tablespaces for different types of objects (e.g., separate tablespaces for tables, indexes, and temporary data).
- Regularly monitor the free space in your default tablespace and allocate additional space as needed to avoid performance issues.

## Conclusion

Default tablespaces in SQL serve as the default storage location for database objects when no specific tablespace is specified during creation. You can view and change the default tablespace using SQL statements. By considering your storage requirements and regularly monitoring space usage, you can ensure optimal performance and manage your database effectively.
