Time-series data refers to data that is recorded and represented in sequential order over time. Common examples include sensor data, stock prices, weather data, and website analytics. Storing and querying time-series data efficiently can be a challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets.

One approach to optimize the storage and retrieval of time-series data in SQL databases is denormalization. Denormalization involves combining related data into a single table to eliminate the need for joins and improve query performance. In this blog post, we'll explore some denormalization patterns for time-series data in SQL databases.

## 1. Flat Table Denormalization

The flat table denormalization pattern involves storing all the time-series data in a single table. Each row represents a unique data point, with columns representing different attributes such as timestamp, value, and tags. This pattern is suitable for scenarios where the number of unique attributes is small and well-defined.

### Example Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  value FLOAT,
  sensor_id INT,
  sensor_location VARCHAR(50),
  PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, sensor_id)
);
```

In this example, the sensor_data table contains columns for timestamp, value, sensor_id, and sensor_location. The primary key consists of the timestamp and sensor_id columns, ensuring uniqueness and efficient retrieval.

## 2. Wide Table Denormalization

The wide table denormalization pattern involves denormalizing time-series data by pivoting it into a wide table format. Each column represents a specific attribute or tag, and the rows represent different timestamps. This pattern is suitable for scenarios where the number of unique attributes is large and not well-defined.

### Example Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data_wide (
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  value1 FLOAT,
  value2 FLOAT,
  value3 FLOAT,
  ...
);
```

In this example, the sensor_data_wide table has a column for each unique attribute (e.g., value1, value2, value3). Each row represents a timestamp, and the corresponding attribute values are stored in the respective columns. This denormalization pattern allows for efficient querying by attribute values without the need for joins.

## Conclusion

Denormalization can be a powerful technique to optimize the storage and retrieval of time-series data in SQL databases. Both the flat table and wide table denormalization patterns have their use cases, depending on the number and nature of attributes in the data.

When denormalizing time-series data, it's essential to weigh the benefits of improved query performance against the trade-offs of increased data duplication and storage requirements. Careful consideration should be given to data modeling, indexing, and query patterns to ensure the best possible performance.
