When working with Oracle databases, it is essential to keep track of the tablespace quotas for different users. This information can help you understand resource allocation and manage storage efficiently. In this article, we will explore how to query tablespace quotas using SQL.

To get started, let's assume you have the necessary access privileges to query the relevant data dictionary views. We will be using the `DBA_TS_QUOTAS` view, which contains information about tablespace quotas granted to different users.

To query the tablespace quotas, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT username, tablespace_name, bytes, max_bytes
FROM dba_ts_quotas;
```

This query retrieves the `username`, `tablespace_name`, `bytes` (the current allocated space), and `max_bytes` (the maximum space allowed) for each user's tablespace quota.

To filter the results for a specific user, you can add a `WHERE` clause as follows:

```sql
SELECT username, tablespace_name, bytes, max_bytes
FROM dba_ts_quotas
WHERE username = 'your_username';
```

Replace `'your_username'` with the actual username for which you want to retrieve the tablespace quota information.

Additionally, if you want the results sorted by a specific column, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause. For example, to sort the results by tablespace name in ascending order, you can modify the query like this:

```sql
SELECT username, tablespace_name, bytes, max_bytes
FROM dba_ts_quotas
WHERE username = 'your_username'
ORDER BY tablespace_name ASC;
```

Remember to replace `'your_username'` with the actual username you are interested in.

Using the above SQL queries, you can easily retrieve and analyze the tablespace quota information for different users in your Oracle database. This information can be helpful for monitoring and managing resource allocation effectively.
