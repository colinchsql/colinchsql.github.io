In SQL, a tablespace is a logical storage container that groups related database objects together. In certain scenarios, you may need to move specific tables from one tablespace to another. This could be due to performance optimization, managing storage resources, or other administrative reasons.

To move specific tables to a different tablespace, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the tables**: First, you need to identify the tables that you want to move. You can either move individual tables or a group of tables together.

2. **Create a new tablespace**: Before moving the tables, you need to create a new tablespace where you want to relocate them. You can use the `CREATE TABLESPACE` statement to create a new tablespace with the desired settings such as datafile size, location, and other parameters.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLESPACE new_tablespace
   DATAFILE '/path/to/new_tablespace.dbf' SIZE 100M;
   ```

   Replace `new_tablespace` with the name of the new tablespace and `/path/to/new_tablespace.dbf` with the appropriate file path for the datafile.

3. **Alter the tables**: Once the new tablespace is created, you need to alter the tables you want to move and specify the new tablespace using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE your_table MOVE TABLESPACE new_tablespace;
   ```

   Replace `your_table` with the name of the table you want to move and `new_tablespace` with the name of the new tablespace.

   Repeat this step for each table you want to move.

4. **Verify the move**: Finally, you can verify that the tables have been moved to the new tablespace by checking the tablespace name associated with each table.

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, tablespace_name
   FROM user_tables
   WHERE table_name IN ('your_table1', 'your_table2', ...);
   ```

   Replace `'your_table1', 'your_table2', ...` with the names of the tables you moved. This query will return the table name and the corresponding tablespace name for each table.

By following these steps, you can successfully move specific tables to a different tablespace in SQL. It is important to note that moving tables should be performed with caution and proper testing in a controlled environment to prevent any unintended consequences.
