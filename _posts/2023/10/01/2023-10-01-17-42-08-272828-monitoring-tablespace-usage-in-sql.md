As a database administrator or developer, it is essential to stay vigilant of the space utilization in your database's tablespaces. Monitoring and managing tablespace usage helps ensure optimal database performance and prevents any potential issues such as disk space shortages.

In this blog post, we will explore various SQL queries and techniques to monitor tablespace usage in your database.

## 1. Checking Tablespace Sizes

To begin, let's examine the current sizes of all the tablespaces in your database. This information will provide an overview of the allocated space and the amount of free space available.

```sql
SELECT
    tablespace_name,
    round(SUM(bytes) / (1024 * 1024), 2) AS "Total Size (MB)",
    round(SUM(bytes - (bytes - blocks * block_size)) / (1024 * 1024), 2) AS "Used Size (MB)",
    round((SUM(bytes) - SUM(bytes - (bytes - blocks * block_size))) / (1024 * 1024), 2) AS "Free Size (MB)",
    round((1 - ((SUM(bytes - (bytes - blocks * block_size))) / SUM(bytes)))) * 100 AS "Used %"
FROM
    dba_data_files
GROUP BY
    tablespace_name;
```

This query retrieves the total size, used size, free size, and the percentage of usage for each tablespace in the database. The `dba_data_files` view contains information about data files associated with tablespaces.

## 2. Monitoring Tablespace Growth

To monitor the growth of a specific tablespace, you can use the following query to calculate the daily growth in megabytes:

```sql
SELECT
    tablespace_name,
    to_char(begin_interval_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "Date",
    round((sum(space_used_delta) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS "Space Used (MB)"
FROM
    dba_hist_tbspc_space_usage
WHERE
    tablespace_name = 'your_tablespace_name'
    AND begin_interval_time >= trunc(sysdate) - 7
GROUP BY
    tablespace_name,
    to_char(begin_interval_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD');
```

This query retrieves the daily space usage of a particular tablespace for the last 7 days, using the `dba_hist_tbspc_space_usage` view. You should replace `'your_tablespace_name'` with the actual name of the tablespace you want to monitor.

## 3. Alarming on Tablespace Space Usage

To receive notifications or take specific actions when a tablespace reaches a certain threshold, you can create database triggers or scheduled jobs. Here is an example of a trigger that raises an alert when the free space in a tablespace goes below a specified limit:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER check_tablespace_usage
BEFORE INSERT ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    free_space number;
BEGIN
    SELECT
        round((SUM(bytes - (bytes - blocks * block_size))) / (1024 * 1024), 2)
    INTO
        free_space
    FROM
        dba_data_files
    WHERE
        tablespace_name = 'your_tablespace_name';

    IF free_space < 1000 THEN
        -- Raise an alert, send an email, or perform other actions
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Alert: Tablespace free space is below 1000 MB');
    END IF;
END;
/
```

In this example, the trigger `check_tablespace_usage` will be fired before every `INSERT` operation on a specific table (`your_table`). The trigger calculates the remaining free space in the specified tablespace and triggers an alert whenever it falls below 1000 MB. You can customize the actions inside the `IF` block to suit your requirements.

## Conclusion

Monitoring tablespace usage is crucial for maintaining database health and preventing any performance issues due to space limitations. By regularly checking and tracking tablespaces, you can take proactive measures to manage your database's space effectively. Use the SQL queries and techniques in this article to monitor tablespace usage in your SQL database efficiently.
