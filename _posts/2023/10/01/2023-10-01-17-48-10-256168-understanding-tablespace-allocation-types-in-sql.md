When working with databases in SQL, it is important to understand the concept of tablespaces and the different allocation types associated with them. In this blog post, we will explore the three commonly used tablespace allocation types: uniform, segment, and dictionary managed.

## Uniform Tablespace Allocation

Uniform tablespace allocation is a type of allocation where the database allocates a specific amount of space to each data block within the tablespace. This allocation type ensures that each data block has the same size, regardless of the size of the data it contains.

To create a uniform tablespace, you can use the following SQL statement:
```SQL
CREATE TABLESPACE example_ts DATAFILE '/path/to/datafile.dbf' SIZE 500M REUSE AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL UNIFORM SIZE 1M;
```
The `EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL UNIFORM SIZE 1M` clause specifies that each extent, or group of contiguous data blocks, is 1MB in size.

Uniform tablespace allocation is especially useful when dealing with databases that have a high number of small-sized objects. It helps to prevent wasted space, as each data block is utilized efficiently.

## Segment Tablespace Allocation

Segment tablespace allocation is the default allocation type in Oracle databases. With segment allocation, data extents are allocated based on the segment size, which is determined by the database based on factors such as the size of the data being stored and the overall database configuration.

To create a segment tablespace, you can use the following SQL statement:
```SQL
CREATE TABLESPACE example_ts DATAFILE '/path/to/datafile.dbf' SIZE 500M REUSE AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED;
```

Segment tablespace allocation provides more flexibility compared to uniform allocation, as it allows for different segment sizes based on the requirements of the data being stored. However, it also introduces the possibility of wasted space, as the size of each extent is determined by the segment size.

## Dictionary Managed Tablespace Allocation

Dictionary managed tablespace allocation is an older method of allocation that is being phased out in favor of newer allocation methods like uniform and segment allocation. In dictionary managed tablespaces, the dictionary, which contains metadata about the database, is responsible for managing the allocation of extents.

To create a dictionary managed tablespace, you can use the following SQL statement:
```SQL
CREATE TABLESPACE example_ts DATAFILE '/path/to/datafile.dbf' SIZE 500M REUSE AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 100M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL DICTIONARY;
```

While dictionary managed tablespaces were widely used in the past, they have several limitations and are not recommended for new databases. They are known to be inefficient in terms of space utilization and can lead to fragmentation over time.

## Conclusion

Understanding the different tablespace allocation types in SQL is essential for effectively managing and optimizing database storage. Uniform allocation offers a consistent size for data blocks, segment allocation provides flexibility with varying segment sizes, and dictionary managed allocation is an outdated method with limitations.

By choosing the appropriate tablespace allocation type based on the nature of your data and storage requirements, you can ensure optimal performance and efficient use of database resources.
