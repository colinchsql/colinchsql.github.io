In distributed transactional systems, one common performance issue is the SQL N+1 query problem. This problem occurs when a query is executed multiple times in a loop, resulting in excessive database queries and negatively impacting system performance. 

To mitigate this issue, there are several strategies that can be employed:

## 1. Eager Loading

Eager loading is a technique where related data is fetched in a single query rather than making separate queries for each related object. This approach reduces the number of queries executed and improves the performance of the system.

Let's consider an example in Python using an ORM library like Django:

```python
# Fetching all orders and eager loading related customer information
orders = Order.objects.select_related('customer').all()

for order in orders:
    # Accessing related customer information without additional queries
    customer_name = order.customer.name
    # ...
```

By using the `select_related` method, we can fetch the related customer information in the initial query, avoiding the N+1 problem.

## 2. Caching

Caching is another effective strategy to handle the SQL N+1 query problem. By caching frequently accessed data, we can avoid redundant queries and improve system performance. Implementing a cache layer can be done using various tools and techniques, such as Redis or Memcached.

Here's an example in Java using the Spring framework and Hibernate ORM:

```java
// Enabling second-level cache in Hibernate configuration
@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class HibernateConfig {

    // ...

    @Bean
    public CacheManager cacheManager() {
        return new ConcurrentMapCacheManager("orders");
    }
}

// Fetching orders with caching support
@Autowired
private OrderRepository orderRepository;

@Cacheable("orders")
public List<Order> getOrders() {
    // Fetching orders from the repository
    return orderRepository.findAll();
}
```

In this example, the `@Cacheable` annotation is used to cache the results of the `getOrders` method. Subsequent calls to the method will be served from the cache, reducing the number of queries executed.
