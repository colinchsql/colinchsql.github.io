In SQL databases, storing hierarchical data can be a challenging task. Hierarchical data represents a parent-child relationship, where each child can have multiple parents. One common approach to store hierarchical data is through normalization, where each node in the hierarchy is stored in a separate table. However, this can lead to complex join queries and performance issues. 

An alternative approach is denormalization, where hierarchical data is stored in a single table. This eliminates the need for joins and allows for simpler queries and improved performance. In this blog post, we will explore some denormalization patterns for storing hierarchical data in SQL databases.

# Adjacency List Pattern

The adjacency list pattern is one of the simplest ways to represent hierarchical data in a single table. In this pattern, each row in the table represents a node in the hierarchy, while an additional column stores the identifier of its parent node.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hierarchical_data (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  parent_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES hierarchical_data(id)
);
```

To retrieve the children of a node, a self-join query is used:

```sql
SELECT c.* 
FROM hierarchical_data AS p 
JOIN hierarchical_data AS c 
ON c.parent_id = p.id 
WHERE p.name = 'Parent Node';
```

# Nested Set Pattern

The nested set pattern uses a different approach to represent hierarchical data. In this pattern, each node in the hierarchy is assigned two additional columns: `left` and `right`. The left value represents the left boundary of the node's subtree, while the right value represents the right boundary.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hierarchical_data (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  left INT,
  right INT
);
```

To retrieve the children of a node, a simple range query is used:

```sql
SELECT c.* 
FROM hierarchical_data AS p 
JOIN hierarchical_data AS c 
ON c.left > p.left AND c.right < p.right 
WHERE p.name = 'Parent Node';
```

# Conclusion 

Denormalization patterns provide efficient ways to store hierarchical data in SQL databases. The adjacency list pattern and nested set pattern are popular choices depending on the requirements of the application. With proper indexing and query optimization, these denormalization patterns can significantly improve the performance of hierarchical queries.
