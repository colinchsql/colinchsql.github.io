In high-throughput transactional systems, handling the SQL N+1 query problem is crucial to ensure optimal performance. The N+1 query problem occurs when an application makes N+1 separate queries to the database, where N is the number of records fetched in an initial query. This can lead to significant performance overhead as the application needs to make multiple database round trips, resulting in increased latency and resource utilization.

To mitigate the SQL N+1 query problem, consider the following strategies:

## 1. Eager Loading with Joins

Eager loading is a technique where the application fetches all the required data from the database in a single query using SQL joins. By fetching the necessary data upfront, the number of round trips to the database can be reduced, minimizing the performance impact of the N+1 query problem.

```sql
SELECT users.id, users.name, orders.order_id, orders.total
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
WHERE users.id = 123;
```

By joining the `users` and `orders` tables in a single query, the application can fetch the user details along with their associated orders, eliminating the need for additional queries.

## 2. Implementing Caching

Caching can significantly improve the performance of high-throughput transactional systems by reducing the number of database queries. By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, subsequent requests can be served from the cache instead of querying the database.

```python
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user_orders = cache.get('user_orders_{}'.format(user_id))

    if user_orders is None:
        # Fetch orders from the database
        user_orders = fetch_orders_from_database(user_id)

        # Store orders in the cache
        cache.set('user_orders_{}'.format(user_id), user_orders)

    return user_orders
```

In this example, the `get_user_orders` function first checks the cache for the user's orders. If the data is not found in the cache, it fetches the orders from the database and stores them in the cache for future use. Subsequent requests for the same user's orders can be served directly from the cache, reducing the overhead of additional database queries.
