In time-critical scenarios, optimizing database performance is crucial. One effective approach is denormalization, which involves combining normalized data structures into fewer tables. This reduces the number of joins required and improves query execution time. In this article, we will explore some denormalization patterns for time-critical SQL databases.

## 1. Flatten Hierarchical Data

Hierarchical data, such as nested categories or organizational structures, can be challenging to query efficiently. By denormalizing the data and flattening the hierarchy into a single table, we can simplify the queries. For example, instead of joining multiple tables to retrieve all related data, we can combine them into a single table and perform faster queries.

```
CREATE TABLE flattened_categories (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_category_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

## 2. Precompute Aggregates

Aggregations, such as sum, count, or average, can be resource-intensive when executed on large datasets. By precomputing and storing these aggregates in a separate table, we can significantly improve the performance of queries that require such calculations. This approach is especially useful when dealing with time-series data or analytical workloads.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE product_stats (
    date DATE,
    total_products INT,
    average_price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

## Conclusion

Denormalization is a powerful technique to optimize the performance of time-critical SQL databases. By flattening hierarchical data and precomputing aggregates, we can simplify complex queries and reduce execution time. However, it is essential to strike a balance between denormalization and data integrity. Over-denormalization may introduce redundancy and increase the risk of data inconsistencies. Therefore, careful analysis and planning are required before implementing denormalization patterns.
