## Introduction
In the world of data processing, the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process plays a crucial role. ETL refers to the process of extracting data from different sources, transforming it to meet a specific format or structure, and then loading it into a target database. One common challenge encountered during the ETL process is dealing with normalized data schemas.

Normalized data schemas are designed to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity. However, they can pose difficulties when it comes to querying and reporting on the data. In such cases, denormalization techniques can be applied to improve performance and simplify data retrieval.

## What is Denormalization?

Denormalization is the process of organizing data in a non-normalized way to optimize query performance. It involves combining tables and duplicating data to eliminate the need for complex join operations. While denormalization can improve query performance, it also introduces data redundancy and the possibility of data inconsistencies.

## Denormalization Techniques:
Below are some commonly used denormalization techniques in SQL databases:

### 1. Flattening:
Flattening involves merging multiple related tables into a single table by including all relevant columns. This reduces the need for joining tables during queries and simplifies the data model. Flattening can be useful when dealing with dimensional data models or star schemas.

```sql
-- Example of flattening tables:
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;
```

### 2. Adding Derived Columns:
Derived columns can be added to a table, which are calculated based on existing columns. These calculated columns eliminate the need for complex computations during query execution. It improves performance by pre-calculating values that are frequently used.

```sql
-- Example of derived column:
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD total_price DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED;
```

### 3. Materialized Views:
Materialized views are pre-computed views stored as physical tables. They are updated periodically or incrementally based on changes to the underlying data. Materialized views improve query performance by eliminating the need for complex joins and computations.

```sql
-- Example of materialized view:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales
AS SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY month;
```

## Conclusion
Denormalization techniques can significantly improve performance in SQL databases during the ETL process. However, it's essential to carefully consider the trade-offs they introduce, such as data redundancy and the potential for inconsistency. Each denormalization technique should be evaluated based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data being processed.
