When working with SQL stored procedures, temporary tables can be a useful tool for storing and manipulating data within a specific session or transaction. Temporary tables are private to the connection that created them and are automatically dropped when the connection is closed. In this blog post, we will explore how to create and use temporary tables within SQL stored procedures.

## Creating Temporary Tables

To create a temporary table within a stored procedure, you need to specify the `CREATE TABLE` statement followed by the name of the temporary table and its columns. Temporary tables are typically prefixed with a single hash (#) or double hash (##) to distinguish them from permanent tables.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE CreateTempTable
AS
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE #TempTable
    (
        ID INT,
        Name VARCHAR(50)
    )
 
    -- Rest of the stored procedure logic
END
```

In the example above, we create a stored procedure called `CreateTempTable` that creates a temporary table called `#TempTable` with two columns, `ID` and `Name`.

## Using Temporary Tables

Once you have created a temporary table, you can use it within the stored procedure to store and manipulate data. You can perform various operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, or selecting data from the temporary table.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE UseTempTable
AS
BEGIN
    -- Insert data into the temporary table
    INSERT INTO #TempTable (ID, Name)
    VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Jane')

    -- Update data in the temporary table
    UPDATE #TempTable
    SET Name = 'Alice'
    WHERE ID = 2

    -- Delete data from the temporary table
    DELETE FROM #TempTable
    WHERE ID = 1

    -- Select data from the temporary table
    SELECT *
    FROM #TempTable
END
```

In the above example, we create a stored procedure called `UseTempTable` that performs various operations on the `#TempTable`. We insert two rows into the temporary table, update the name for one of the rows, delete one row based on the ID, and finally select all the data from the temporary table.

## Dropping Temporary Tables

As mentioned earlier, temporary tables are automatically dropped when the connection is closed. However, it is considered good practice to explicitly drop the temporary table within the stored procedure using the `DROP TABLE` statement.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE DropTempTable
AS
BEGIN
    -- Drop the temporary table if it exists
    IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#TempTable') IS NOT NULL
    BEGIN
        DROP TABLE #TempTable
    END
 
    -- Rest of the stored procedure logic
END
```

In the example above, we create a stored procedure called `DropTempTable` that checks if the `#TempTable` exists and then drops it if it is present.

## Conclusion

Temporary tables are a powerful feature in SQL stored procedures that allow you to store and manipulate data within a specific session or transaction. By understanding how to create, use, and drop temporary tables, you can enhance the functionality and performance of your SQL stored procedures.
