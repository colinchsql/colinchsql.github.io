In a database system, it is essential to enforce granular security permissions to ensure that sensitive data is protected and accessed only by authorized users. One effective way to achieve this is through the use of SQL stored procedures, which provide a secure and controllable environment for executing database logic. In this article, we will explore several strategies for implementing granular security permissions within SQL stored procedures.

## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

Role-Based Access Control is a widely-used approach for managing permissions in a database system. In RBAC, permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to one or more roles. By defining roles based on different job functions or responsibilities, you can grant or revoke permissions to a group of users. 

To implement RBAC within SQL stored procedures, you can create roles and associate them with specific stored procedures. Inside each stored procedure, you can check the user's role before executing the desired operation. 

```sql
CREATE ROLE administrator;
CREATE ROLE user;

GRANT EXECUTE ON stored_procedure_admin TO administrator;
GRANT EXECUTE ON stored_procedure_user TO user;

CREATE PROCEDURE stored_procedure_admin
AS
BEGIN
    IF IS_MEMBER('administrator') = 1
    BEGIN
        -- Perform admin operations
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- Access denied
    END
END

CREATE PROCEDURE stored_procedure_user
AS 
BEGIN
    IF IS_MEMBER('user') = 1
    BEGIN
        -- Perform user operations
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- Access denied
    END
END
```

## 2. Parameterized Queries

Another strategy for implementing granular security permissions within SQL stored procedures is by using parameterized queries. 

Instead of embedding user inputs directly into SQL statements, you should use input parameters in your stored procedures. This approach eliminates the risk of SQL injection attacks and allows for fine-grained control over data access.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_data
    @customer_id INT
AS
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM customers WHERE id = @customer_id AND created_by = USER_NAME())
    BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = @customer_id;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- Access denied
    END
END
```

In the example above, the stored procedure `get_customer_data` takes a parameter `@customer_id` and checks if the logged-in user created the customer record before returning the data. This ensures that only the appropriate users can access the requested information.

By implementing these strategies, you can enhance the security of your SQL stored procedures and ensure that sensitive data remains protected. Remember to regularly review and update your security measures as new threats emerge and your database system evolves.
