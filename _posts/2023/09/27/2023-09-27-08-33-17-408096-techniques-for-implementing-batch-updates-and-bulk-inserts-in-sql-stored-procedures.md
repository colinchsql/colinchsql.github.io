When working with large datasets, it is important to optimize your code for efficiency and performance. One way to achieve this in SQL is by using batch updates and bulk inserts. These techniques allow you to process multiple rows of data in a single operation, significantly reducing the number of round trips to the database and improving overall performance.

In this blog post, we will explore two common techniques for implementing batch updates and bulk inserts in SQL stored procedures: the Table-Valued Parameter approach and the Bulk INSERT statement.

## 1. Table-Valued Parameter Approach

The Table-Valued Parameter (TVP) approach allows you to pass a table of data as a parameter to a stored procedure. This technique is available in SQL Server 2008 and later versions. Here's an example of how to implement a batch update using TVPs:

```sql
CREATE TYPE dbo.EmployeeType AS TABLE
(
    EmployeeId INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.UpdateEmployees
    @Employees dbo.EmployeeType READONLY
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE e
    SET e.FirstName = emp.FirstName,
        e.LastName = emp.LastName
    FROM dbo.Employees e
    INNER JOIN @Employees emp ON e.EmployeeId = emp.EmployeeId;
END;
```

To use this stored procedure, you would need to create a DataTable object in your application code and populate it with the data you want to update. Then, pass this DataTable as a parameter to the stored procedure.

NOTE: Before calling the stored procedure, make sure to define and populate the DataTable with data properly.

## 2. Bulk INSERT Statement

The Bulk INSERT statement is another efficient way to perform bulk inserts in SQL. It allows you to insert multiple rows of data from a file or directly from a table into a target table. Here's an example of how to use the Bulk INSERT statement:

```sql
BULK INSERT dbo.Employees
FROM 'C:\Data\Employees.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'
);
```

In this example, we are inserting data from a CSV file directly into the `Employees` table. Make sure to specify the correct file path and appropriate field and row terminators based on your data file format.

Both the TVP approach and the Bulk INSERT statement offer efficient ways to handle batch updates and bulk inserts in SQL stored procedures. Consider using these techniques when dealing with large datasets to improve the performance and scalability of your applications.
