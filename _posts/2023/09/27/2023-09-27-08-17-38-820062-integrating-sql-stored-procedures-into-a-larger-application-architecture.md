Stored procedures are a powerful feature of SQL databases that allow you to define and execute sets of SQL statements in a controlled and reusable way. They can improve the performance and maintainability of your database operations by encapsulating complex logic and executing it on the database server.

When integrating SQL stored procedures into a larger application architecture, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind.

**1. Choosing the Right Database**
Before incorporating stored procedures into your application, it's important to select a database that supports them. Most popular databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server provide built-in support for stored procedures. Ensure that your chosen database supports the specific functionality you require, and evaluate any limitations or quirks that may impact the integration process.

**2. Designing the Stored Procedures**
To effectively incorporate stored procedures into your application, it's crucial to design them in a way that aligns with your application's overall architecture and requirements. This involves clearly defining the input parameters, output results, and any error handling mechanisms. By designing the stored procedures with flexibility and reusability in mind, you can ensure smoother integration with other components of your application.

**3. Establishing a Communication Layer**
To invoke stored procedures from your application, you need to establish a communication layer between your application code and the database. This typically involves using a database access layer or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that provides an abstraction to interact with the database and execute the stored procedures. The communication layer should handle connection management, parameter passing, and result retrieval, ensuring efficient and secure interaction with the database.

**4. Security and Permissions**
Stored procedures can execute with the permissions of the user account that invokes them. It is crucial to carefully manage the security and permissions associated with executing stored procedures in your application. Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can execute the stored procedures, and define granular permissions to restrict access to sensitive data or operations.

**5. Error Handling and Logging**
Effective error handling and logging mechanisms are essential for a robust integration of stored procedures. Determine how errors and exceptions should be handled within the stored procedure code, and propagate meaningful error messages or codes back to the application layer. Logging any errors or exceptions encountered during the execution of stored procedures can help with troubleshooting and maintenance.
