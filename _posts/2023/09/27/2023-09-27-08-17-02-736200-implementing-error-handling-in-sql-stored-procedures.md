When working with SQL stored procedures, it is important to handle errors and exceptions gracefully to provide a better user experience and avoid any potential data integrity issues. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement error handling in SQL stored procedures to catch and handle errors effectively.

## 1. Using TRY...CATCH block

The `TRY...CATCH` block in SQL Server allows us to write code that can catch and handle exceptions. Here's an example of how to use the `TRY...CATCH` block in a SQL stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SampleProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Your SQL Statements here
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Error handling code here
    END CATCH;
END;
```

In the above example, any SQL statements inside the `TRY` block will be executed, and if any error occurs, it will be caught by the `CATCH` block.

## 2. Capturing Error Information

Inside the `CATCH` block, we can capture detailed information about the error using functions like `ERROR_NUMBER()`, `ERROR_STATE()`, `ERROR_MESSAGE()`, `ERROR_PROCEDURE()`, etc. Here's an example of how to capture and log the error information:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SampleProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Your SQL Statements here
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000) = ERROR_MESSAGE();
        DECLARE @ErrorNumber INT = ERROR_NUMBER();
        DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT = ERROR_SEVERITY();
        DECLARE @ErrorState INT = ERROR_STATE();
        DECLARE @ErrorProcedure NVARCHAR(128) = ERROR_PROCEDURE();
        
        -- Log the error details
        INSERT INTO dbo.ErrorLog (ErrorMessage, ErrorNumber, ErrorSeverity, ErrorState, ErrorProcedure)
        VALUES (@ErrorMessage, @ErrorNumber, @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState, @ErrorProcedure);
        
        -- Optionally, raise the error
        -- THROW;
    END CATCH;
END;
```

In the above example, we capture the error message, number, severity, state, and procedure into variables and then insert them into an error log table. You can customize this based on your specific requirements.

## 3. Raising Custom Errors

In addition to capturing and logging errors, you can also raise custom errors using the `THROW` statement inside the `CATCH` block. Here's an example of how to raise a custom error:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SampleProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Your SQL Statements here
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000) = 'An error occurred.';
        DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT = 16;
        
        -- Log the error details
        INSERT INTO dbo.ErrorLog (ErrorMessage, ErrorSeverity)
        VALUES (@ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity);
        
        -- Raising custom error
        THROW 50001, @ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity;
    END CATCH;
END;
```

In the above example, we set a custom error message and severity, log it into the error log table, and then use the `THROW` statement to raise the custom error to the caller.

## Conclusion

Implementing error handling in SQL stored procedures is crucial for delivering robust and reliable database applications. By using the `TRY...CATCH` block and capturing error information, we can handle errors effectively and provide a better user experience. Additionally, raising custom errors allows us to handle specific scenarios and communicate them clearly. Incorporating error handling techniques discussed in this blog post will ensure the stability and integrity of your SQL stored procedures.
