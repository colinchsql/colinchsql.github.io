Concurrency control is a critical aspect of database management systems that ensures correct and consistent execution of concurrent transactions. In SQL stored procedures, implementing and utilizing advanced concurrency control mechanisms can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of the system. In this blog post, we will explore some effective techniques for achieving advanced concurrency control within SQL stored procedures.

## 1. Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)

OCC is a concurrency control method where transactions are allowed to proceed independently until they are ready to commit. During the commit phase, conflicts are detected, and if any conflicts occur, appropriate actions are taken to handle them. The key principle behind OCC is to assume that conflicts are infrequent, allowing greater concurrency.

To implement OCC in SQL stored procedures, you can utilize a combination of techniques:

- **Versioning**: Maintain version numbers for each row or record in the database. When a transaction reads a record, it also reads the corresponding version number. During the commit phase, if the version number has changed, a conflict is detected.
- **Timestamping**: Assign a unique timestamp to each transaction. This timestamp can be compared during the commit phase to detect conflicts.

```sql
-- Example code for implementing OCC using versioning
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DECLARE @old_version INTEGER;
READ @old_version FROM VersionsTable WHERE record_id = @record_id;
IF @old_version = @current_version THEN
    -- Perform necessary updates to the record
    UPDATE RecordsTable SET value = @new_value WHERE record_id = @record_id;
    UPDATE VersionsTable SET version = @new_version WHERE record_id = @record_id;
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
ELSE
    -- Handle conflict
    -- Rollback or retry the transaction as appropriate
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END IF;
```

## 2. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)

PCC is a concurrency control mechanism where transactions obtain locks on resources before accessing them, ensuring that no other transaction can modify those resources until the locks are released. PCC reduces the probability of conflicts as locks prevent concurrent access.

To implement PCC in SQL stored procedures, you can utilize lock mechanisms available in your database system:

- **Row-level locking**: Lock individual rows in a table to prevent other transactions from modifying them concurrently. This can be achieved by using the `FOR UPDATE` clause in SQL statements.
- **Table-level locking**: Lock entire tables to prevent any modifications by other transactions. However, this can limit concurrency and should be used judiciously.

```sql
-- Example code for implementing PCC using row-level locking
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM RecordsTable WHERE record_id = @record_id FOR UPDATE;
-- Perform necessary updates to the record
UPDATE RecordsTable SET value = @new_value WHERE record_id = @record_id;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
