In SQL, you can call and execute a stored procedure from within another stored procedure. This can be useful when you want to combine the functionality of multiple procedures into a single, more complex procedure.

To call and execute a stored procedure from another stored procedure, you can use the `EXEC` statement.

Here is an example of how to accomplish this in SQL:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ParentProcedure
AS
BEGIN
  -- Your code here

  -- Call and execute the child procedure
  EXEC dbo.ChildProcedure
END
GO

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ChildProcedure
AS
BEGIN
  -- Your code here

  -- Execution logic for the child procedure
END
GO
```

In the example above, we have two stored procedures: `ParentProcedure` and `ChildProcedure`. The `ParentProcedure` is calling and executing the `ChildProcedure` using the `EXEC` statement.

To run the `ParentProcedure`, you simply execute it:

```sql
EXEC dbo.ParentProcedure
```

By executing the `ParentProcedure`, it will internally call and execute the `ChildProcedure` as well.

Note that you need to create the child procedure before calling it from the parent procedure to ensure that it exists.

Be mindful of the order of execution and any dependencies between the stored procedures to avoid any issues or conflicts during execution.

# Conclusion

Calling and executing a SQL stored procedure from another stored procedure can help in organizing and reusing code functionality. By using the `EXEC` statement, you can easily incorporate one procedure into another, making your SQL code more modular and efficient.
