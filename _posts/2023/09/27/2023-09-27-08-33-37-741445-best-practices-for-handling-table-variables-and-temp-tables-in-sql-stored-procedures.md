When writing SQL stored procedures, it's essential to optimize performance and improve efficiency. One area that often requires attention is the way table variables and temp tables are used within the procedure. In this blog post, we will discuss some best practices for handling table variables and temp tables in SQL stored procedures that can help enhance performance and maintainability.

### 1. Use Table Variables for Small Result Sets

**Table variables** are memory-based structures that hold data like regular tables but have some limitations compared to temp tables. They are best suited for smaller result sets, typically containing a few hundred rows or less. Table variables are created in memory, allowing for fast access and data processing.

To declare a table variable in SQL Server, use the `DECLARE` statement with the `@` symbol:

```sql
DECLARE @MyTableVariable TABLE (
    Column1 DataType,
    Column2 DataType,
    ...
);
```

### 2. Use Temp Tables for Larger Result Sets

**Temp tables** are physical tables that are created in the tempdb database. They can hold larger result sets and are more optimized for handling a significant amount of data. If your stored procedure involves complex calculations, sorting, or multiple operations on a large dataset, it's advisable to use temp tables.

To create a temp table in SQL Server, use the `CREATE TABLE` statement with a unique name starting with a `#` symbol:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #MyTempTable (
    Column1 DataType,
    Column2 DataType,
    ...
);
```

### 3. Be Mindful of Table Variable Performance

While table variables offer advantages for small result sets, they may not perform as well as temp tables for larger data. Table variables do not have statistics, and the query optimizer assumes that they contain only one row.

To overcome this limitation, you can use `OPTION(RECOMPILE)` at the end of your query when querying table variables. This ensures that the query plan is recompiled each time the stored procedure is executed, taking into account the actual number of rows in the table variable.

### 4. Use Proper Indexing

Just like regular tables, both table variables and temp tables benefit from proper indexing. If your stored procedure involves frequent searching, filtering, or joining operations, consider adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance.

You can create indexes on table variables using the same syntax as regular tables:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_MyTableVariable ON @MyTableVariable(Column1);
```

Similarly, you can create indexes on temp tables:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_MyTempTable ON #MyTempTable(Column1);
```

### Conclusion

By following these best practices, you can ensure optimal performance and maintainability when working with table variables and temp tables in SQL stored procedures. Utilizing table variables for smaller result sets and temp tables for larger datasets, considering performance implications, and using proper indexing techniques will help improve the overall efficiency of your stored procedures.
