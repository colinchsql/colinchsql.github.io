Searching for data is a common requirement in many applications. In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement search functionality using a SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.

## What is SQL ORM?

SQL ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented programming language. It simplifies the process of working with databases by providing high-level abstractions, eliminating the need to write raw SQL queries.

## The Setup

Before we dive into implementing search functionality, let's set up a basic project structure and initialize our SQL ORM.

```python
# install the SQL ORM library
pip install sql-orm

# import the necessary modules
from sql_orm import Database, Table, Column

# create a new database
db = Database('my_database')

# create a new table
users = Table('users', [
    Column('id', 'integer', primary_key=True),
    Column('name', 'text'),
    Column('email', 'text')
])

# add the table to the database
db.create_table(users)
```

In the above code, we create a new database `my_database` and define a table `users` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email`. We then add the table to the database using the `create_table()` method.

## Implementing Search Functionality

To implement search functionality, we need to add a search method to our SQL ORM. One approach is to create a helper function that accepts a search term and returns the matching results from the database.

```python
def search_users(search_term):
    # create a SQL query to search for users
    query = users.select().where(users.name.contains(search_term))

    # execute the query and retrieve the results
    results = db.execute(query)

    # return the matching users
    return results.fetchall()
```

In the above code, we use the `select()` method to build a SQL query that searches for users whose name contains the `search_term`. We then execute the query using the `execute()` method of the database object and retrieve the results using the `fetchall()` method.

## Testing the Search Functionality

Let's test our search functionality by searching for users with a specific name.

```python
# search for users with name 'John'
search_results = search_users('John')

# print the matching users
for user in search_results:
    print(user)
```

The output will display the users whose name contains 'John'.

## Conclusion

Implementing search functionality with SQL ORM simplifies the process of searching and retrieving data from a database. By utilizing the high-level abstractions provided by the SQL ORM, developers can focus more on the application logic and less on writing complex SQL queries.
