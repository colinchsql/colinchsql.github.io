In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to get the last value in a group of rows, based on an ordering specified by the `ORDER BY` clause. Additionally, you can use an `IF` statement to conditionally perform certain actions based on a given condition.

## Syntax of LAST_VALUE function:

The syntax for using the `LAST_VALUE` function is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column [ASC | DESC] ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

## Usage of LAST_VALUE function with IF statement:

You can combine the `LAST_VALUE` function with an `IF` statement to perform conditional operations based on the value returned by `LAST_VALUE`.

Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, IF(LAST_VALUE(column1) = 'some condition', 'true', 'false') AS conditional_result
FROM your_table
ORDER BY column1
```

In this example, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to get the last value of `column1`, and then an `IF` statement is used to check if the last value satisfies a specific condition. If the condition is true, the result will be 'true'; otherwise, it will be 'false'.

## Example Scenario:

Let's consider a scenario where you have a table named `orders`, which contains information about customer orders, including the `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_status`. You want to retrieve the last order of each customer and display whether the order is 'complete' or 'pending'.

Here is an example query:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, LAST_VALUE(order_status) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_id DESC) AS last_order_status,
       IF(LAST_VALUE(order_status) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_id DESC) = 'complete', 'true', 'false') AS is_complete
FROM orders
```

In this query, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last `order_status` for each `customer_id`. Then, an `IF` statement is used to check if the last order status is 'complete'. If it is, the `is_complete` column will have a value of 'true'; otherwise, it will have a value of 'false'.

## Conclusion:

By combining the `LAST_VALUE` function with an `IF` statement in SQL, you can effectively perform conditional operations based on the last value obtained from a group of rows. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to handle the last value based on certain conditions.
