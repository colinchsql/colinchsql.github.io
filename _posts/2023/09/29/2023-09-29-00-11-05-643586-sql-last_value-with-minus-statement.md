In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL along with the `MINUS` statement to get the last value from a column and perform calculations on it.

## What is the LAST_VALUE function?

The `LAST_VALUE` function is a window function in SQL that returns the last value within a specified window frame. It is often used in combination with other functions like `ROW_NUMBER` or `PARTITION BY` to get the desired result.

## Syntax of the LAST_VALUE function

The syntax of the `LAST_VALUE` function is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE (expression) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_clause ORDER BY order_clause
                             ROWS BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end)
```

Here, `expression` represents the column or expression from which you want to get the last value. `partition_clause` allows you to divide the result set into partitions, and `order_clause` specifies the order in which the rows should be evaluated.

## Using SQL LAST_VALUE with MINUS statement

Let's say we have a table called `orders` with the following data:

| order_id | amount |
|----------|--------|
| 1        | 100    |
| 2        | 150    |
| 3        | 200    |
| 4        | 300    |
| 5        | 250    |

Now, suppose we want to find the difference between the last order amount and each order amount. We can achieve this using the `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `MINUS` statement.

Here is an example query that demonstrates this:

```sql
SELECT order_id, amount,
       LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_id) - amount AS difference
FROM orders;
```

In this query, we use the `LAST_VALUE` function to get the last `amount` value in ascending order of `order_id`. We then subtract each `amount` value from the last value using the minus operator.

The result of the above query will be:

| order_id | amount | difference |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 1        | 100    | 150        |
| 2        | 150    | 100        |
| 3        | 200    | 50         |
| 4        | 300    | 0          |
| 5        | 250    | 50         |

As you can see, the `difference` column shows the difference between each order amount and the last order amount.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL provides a useful way to get the last value within a specified window frame. By combining it with the `MINUS` statement, you can perform calculations on the last value and achieve the desired result.
