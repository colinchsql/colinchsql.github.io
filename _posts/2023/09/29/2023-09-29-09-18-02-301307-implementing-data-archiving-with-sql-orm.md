In today's fast-paced world, data storage and management play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of an application. One important aspect of data management is archiving, which involves storing and managing historical data that is no longer actively used but still needs to be kept for compliance or reference purposes. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement data archiving using an SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.

## What is SQL ORM?

SQL ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with databases using an object-oriented approach rather than writing raw SQL queries. It abstracts the database operations, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, handle relationships, and manage database schema changes.

## Why Archive Data?

Archiving data helps improve database performance by removing old and infrequently accessed records from active tables. By moving this data to separate archival tables, we can reduce the size of active tables and improve query performance. Additionally, archiving is essential for compliance purposes, as it ensures that historical data is retained and can be accessed if needed.

## Implementing Data Archiving

To implement data archiving, we can leverage the features provided by SQL ORM libraries. Let's take an example of an e-commerce application where we want to archive orders that are older than a year.

### 1. Adding Archive Table

First, we need to create an archival table to store the archived data. This table should have the same structure as the original table, but with additional columns to track the archival date or any other information required.

Here's an example of an archival table for the orders table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE archived_orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  archived_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Moving Data to Archive

Next, we need to implement a mechanism to move the old records from the original table to the archive table. This can be done using a scheduled job or a background process that runs periodically.

In our example, we can create a function that moves orders older than a year to the archival table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION archive_old_orders()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO archived_orders
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date < (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year');
    
  DELETE FROM orders
    WHERE order_date < (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The function `archive_old_orders` moves the required records from the orders table to the archived_orders table and then deletes them from the original table.

### 3. Accessing Archived Data

To access archived data when needed, we can create views or queries that combine data from the active and archival tables. This allows seamless access to historical data without affecting the application logic.

For example, to fetch all orders (both active and archived) for a customer:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM archived_orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

### 4. Automating Data Archiving

Lastly, we should automate the data archiving process to ensure that it runs regularly. This can be achieved using job schedulers or cron jobs, which can execute the archiving function based on a defined schedule.

## Conclusion

Data archiving is an essential component of data management. By leveraging SQL ORM libraries, we can implement data archiving effectively and efficiently. It helps improve database performance and ensures compliance with data retention policies. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can implement data archiving in your application using SQL ORM easily.
