In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value in an ordered set of values. It is often used in combination with the `OVER` clause and window functions to perform complex calculations on multiple rows.

In some scenarios, you may want to use the `LAST_VALUE` function within a `WHILE` loop to iterate through a table's rows and perform certain actions based on the last value. Let's explore how this can be achieved.

## Syntax

The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` with the `WHILE` statement in SQL is as follows:

```sql
DECLARE @lastValue <data_type>;

WHILE <condition>
BEGIN
    SET @lastValue = LAST_VALUE(<expression>) OVER (ORDER BY <order_expression>);
    
    -- Perform actions using @lastValue
    
    -- Additional statements
    
END
```

Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

- `@lastValue`: A variable to store the last value.
- `<data_type>`: The data type of the variable.
- `<condition>`: A condition that determines when the `WHILE` loop should continue or exit.
- `<expression>`: The column or expression from which you want to retrieve the last value.
- `<order_expression>`: The column or expression used to specify the order in which the `LAST_VALUE` function should be evaluated.

## Example

Let's say we have a `sales` table with columns `product_name` and `price`, and we want to iterate through the rows using a `WHILE` loop to perform some actions based on the last price value. Here's an example:

```sql
DECLARE @lastPrice DECIMAL(10, 2);

WHILE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sales WHERE price IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
    SET @lastPrice = LAST_VALUE(price) OVER (ORDER BY product_name);
    
    -- Perform actions with @lastPrice
    PRINT 'Last price: ' + CAST(@lastPrice AS VARCHAR);
    
    -- Additional statements
    
    -- Update or delete records
    UPDATE sales
    SET price = NULL
    WHERE price = @lastPrice;
    
    -- Exit condition for the loop
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sales WHERE price IS NOT NULL)
        BREAK;
END
```

In this example, we declare a variable `@lastPrice` to store the last price value. The `WHILE` loop continues as long as there are rows in the `sales` table with a non-null price. Within the loop, we retrieve the last price using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `price` column and order the results by `product_name`. We then perform actions using the last price value, in this case, printing it to the console and updating the records with that price to set it to null.

Remember to adapt the example code to your specific table structure and requirements.

## Conclusion

By combining the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `WHILE` statement in SQL, you can iterate through a table's rows and perform actions based on the last value. This technique can be useful in various scenarios where you need to process data sequentially using the last value as a reference.
