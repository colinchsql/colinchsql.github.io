When working with databases, **SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a popular technique used to interact with the database using object-oriented programming languages. An ORM helps abstract away the underlying SQL queries and allows developers to work with the database using code that is more familiar and intuitive.

One important consideration when choosing an ORM is its compatibility with different database systems. This ensures that your ORM of choice can seamlessly work with the specific database system you are using.

Let's take a look at the compatibility of some popular SQL ORM frameworks with different database systems:

## 1. SQLAlchemy

**SQLAlchemy** is a widely-used ORM for Python that supports a wide range of database systems including:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Oracle
- MS SQL Server

SQLAlchemy achieves compatibility by providing a consistent API and dialect-specific implementations for different database systems. It allows you to write database-agnostic code while still leveraging the features and performance optimizations of the specific database system you are using.

Example SQLAlchemy code:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# Define database connection URL based on the specific database system
# e.g., postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
db_url = "<DATABASE_URL>"

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine(db_url)

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Define a database table using SQLAlchemy's declarative_base
Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

# Perform database operations using the session
# ...

```

## 2. Django ORM

The **Django ORM** is an integral part of the Django web framework, which is built using Python. It provides a high-level, intuitive API for working with databases. Django ORM is fully compatible with the following databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Oracle
- MS SQL Server

With Django ORM, you can define models that represent database tables and easily perform database operations using the ORM's API.

Example Django ORM code:

```python
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

# Perform database operations using the Django ORM
# ...

```

## Conclusion

When choosing a SQL ORM, it is important to consider its compatibility with different database systems. SQLAlchemy and Django ORM are two widely-used ORMs that provide support for popular databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MS SQL Server. By using these ORMs, you can write database-agnostic code while seamlessly working with your preferred database system.
