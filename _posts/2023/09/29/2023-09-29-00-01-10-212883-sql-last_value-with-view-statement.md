In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value of a specified expression within a group. When combined with the `VIEW` statement, it allows you to create a virtual table that presents the last value of a column or expression in a more convenient way. This can be useful when you need to display the latest information from a dataset.

Here's an example of how you can use the `LAST_VALUE` function with a `VIEW` statement:

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE sales (
  id INT,
  product_name VARCHAR(50),
  sale_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  sale_date DATE
);

--Insert sample data
INSERT INTO sales (id, product_name, sale_amount, sale_date)
VALUES
  (1, 'Product A', 100.50, '2021-01-10'),
  (2, 'Product A', 150.20, '2021-02-15'),
  (3, 'Product B', 75.80, '2021-03-20'),
  (4, 'Product B', 125.40, '2021-04-25');

-- Create a view using LAST_VALUE
CREATE VIEW latest_sales AS
SELECT
  product_name,
  LAST_VALUE(sale_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY product_name
    ORDER BY sale_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
  ) AS last_sale_amount
FROM
  sales;
```

In the example above, we create a table called `sales`, which stores information about product sales. We then insert some sample data into the table.

Next, we create a view called `latest_sales`. Within the view, we use the `LAST_VALUE` function to retrieve the last sale amount for each product. The `PARTITION BY` clause ensures that the function is applied separately to each product, while the `ORDER BY` clause specifies the order in which the rows should be sorted.

By using the `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause, we ensure that the `LAST_VALUE` function considers all rows within the partition.

Now, whenever you query the `latest_sales` view, it will display the product name and the last sale amount for each product, based on the `sale_date`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM latest_sales;
```

This will give you the following result:

```
| product_name | last_sale_amount |
|--------------|------------------|
| Product A    | 150.20           |
| Product B    | 125.40           |
```

In conclusion, using the `LAST_VALUE` function with a `VIEW` statement allows you to simplify the retrieval of the last value of a column or expression in a SQL dataset. This can be especially useful when you need to display the latest information in a more structured and convenient way.
