Data migration is an essential aspect of software development when it comes to database management. When working with SQL databases, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks can simplify the process of migrating data across different versions of the database schema.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement data migration using a SQL ORM such as SQLAlchemy for Python.

## What is Data Migration?

Data migration refers to the process of transferring data from one database to another, or from one version of a database schema to another. This can involve modifying the structure of tables, adding or removing columns, or transforming data to comply with the new schema.

## Using SQLAlchemy for Data Migration

SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM library for Python that provides a powerful set of tools for working with SQL databases. It allows developers to write database-agnostic code and provides an expressive API for performing database operations.

To implement data migration with SQLAlchemy, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a New Migration Script

Start by creating a new migration script that will contain the necessary steps for migrating the data. This script should be version-controlled to track changes over time. You can use a framework like Alembic to handle database versioning and migrations.

### 2. Define the Target Schema

In the migration script, define the target schema that you want to migrate the data to. This includes creating new tables, modifying existing tables, or altering columns.

Use SQLAlchemy's declarative base class to define your table schema. This allows you to define tables, columns, and relationships as Python classes. For example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)
```

### 3. Perform Data Migration

Once you have defined the target schema, you can execute the necessary data migration steps. This may involve querying data from the source database, transforming it if needed, and inserting it into the new schema.

You can use SQLAlchemy's query API to retrieve data from the source tables. Then, iterate over the results and create new objects using the defined target schema.

For example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a database session
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Query data from the source table
source_data = session.query(SourceTable).all()

# Transform and insert data into the target table
for row in source_data:
    session.add(User(name=row.name, email=row.email))

# Commit the changes
session.commit()
```

### 4. Test and Verify

After performing the data migration, it is crucial to test and verify the results. Ensure that the data has been correctly migrated to the target schema and that any transformations or modifications have been applied successfully.

## Conclusion

By using a SQL ORM like SQLAlchemy, data migration becomes a streamlined process in software development. With the ability to define the target schema and perform data transformation, data migration can be implemented efficiently and reliably.
