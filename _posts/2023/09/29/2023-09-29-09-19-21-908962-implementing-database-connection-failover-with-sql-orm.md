In today's world, where databases play a crucial role in the functionality of many applications, it is important to ensure that your application is resilient to any potential database failures. One common approach to achieve this is by implementing database connection failover. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement database connection failover using a SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.

## Why Use a SQL ORM?

SQL ORM tools, such as SQLAlchemy for Python or Hibernate for Java, provide an abstraction layer that simplifies database interactions and allows developers to work with databases using an object-oriented approach. These tools also offer features like connection pooling and query optimization, making them an excellent choice for handling database connectivity.

## Database Connection Failover

Database connection failover is the process of automatically switching to a backup database server in case the primary server becomes unavailable. This ensures that the application continues to function without any disruption.

### Step 1: Define Connection Parameters

The first step in implementing database connection failover is to define the connection parameters for both the primary and backup database servers. These parameters include the host, port, database name, username, and password.

```python
primary_db = {
    "host": "primary-db-host",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "primary-db",
    "username": "primary-user",
    "password": "primary-password"
}

backup_db = {
    "host": "backup-db-host",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "backup-db",
    "username": "backup-user",
    "password": "backup-password"
}
```

### Step 2: Creating ORM Engine

Next, create the ORM engine using the connection parameters defined earlier. The ORM engine is responsible for establishing the initial database connection and managing subsequent connections.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(
    f"postgresql://{primary_db['username']}:{primary_db['password']}@{primary_db['host']}:{primary_db['port']}/{primary_db['database']}"
)
```

### Step 3: Handling Connection Failover

To implement connection failover, we need to detect database failures and switch the connection to the backup server. This can be achieved by defining a custom function that checks the connectivity to the primary database and automatically switches to the backup database in case of failure.

```python
def handle_connection_failover():
    try:
        # Attempt a connection to the primary database
        connection = engine.connect()
        print("Connected to primary database")
        return connection

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Connection to primary database failed: {e}")
        print("Switching to the backup database")

        # Create a new engine using the backup database connection parameters
        backup_engine = create_engine(
            f"postgresql://{backup_db['username']}:{backup_db['password']}@{backup_db['host']}:{backup_db['port']}/{backup_db['database']}"
        )

        # Attempt a connection to the backup database
        backup_connection = backup_engine.connect()
        print("Connected to backup database")
        return backup_connection

# Call the handle_connection_failover function to establish the database connection
connection = handle_connection_failover()
```

### Step 4: Database Operations

Once the connection is established, you can use the ORM tool to perform various database operations, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. The ORM tool will handle the underlying database interactions, including connection management.

```python
# Example query using SQLAlchemy
result = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Iterate over the query results
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

## Conclusion

Implementing database connection failover is essential to ensure the availability and reliability of your application. By using a SQL ORM tool, like SQLAlchemy or Hibernate, you can achieve this failover seamlessly and focus on developing other essential features of your application. Remember to handle potential database failures and switch connections accordingly using the steps outlined in this blog post.
