In SQL, the LAST_VALUE function is used to retrieve the last value in a specified column within a defined order. This function is particularly useful when you want to retrieve the last value of a column without using complex subqueries or temporary tables.

To use the LAST_VALUE function, you can declare a variable using the DECLARE statement, and then assign the last value to that variable in a SELECT statement. Let's look at an example to understand how it works.

## Example:

```sql
DECLARE @lastValue INT; -- Declare a variable to hold the last value

SELECT @lastValue = LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY order_column)
FROM table_name;

PRINT 'The last value is: ' + CAST(@lastValue AS VARCHAR);
```

In the above example, we declared a variable `@lastValue` of type `INT`. We then used the `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause and `ORDER BY` to determine the last value in the specified column. The result is assigned to the variable `@lastValue`. Finally, we printed the last value using the `PRINT` statement.

It's important to note that the `LAST_VALUE` function requires an `ORDER BY` clause to specify the column or columns used to determine the order. This ensures that you get the desired last value properly based on the specified order in the query.

## Conclusion
By using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `DECLARE` statement in SQL, you can easily retrieve the last value of a column based on a specified order. This eliminates the need for complex subqueries or temporary tables, making your SQL queries more concise and efficient.
