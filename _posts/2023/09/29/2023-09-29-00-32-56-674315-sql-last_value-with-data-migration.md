In data migration scenarios, it is common to extract data from one source and load it into another database. During this process, you may need to transform and manipulate the data before loading it. One such transformation is to extract the last value of a column from the source table and insert it into the destination table.

## Understanding the SQL LAST_VALUE Function

The `LAST_VALUE()` function in SQL is a window function that allows you to retrieve the last value of a column within a defined window frame. It is particularly useful when you want to extract the last value in a series or perform calculations based on previous values.

The syntax of the `LAST_VALUE()` function is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY sort_expression
    [ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW]
)
```

Here, the `expression` parameter represents the column or expression you want to retrieve the last value of. The `PARTITION BY` clause enables you to divide the result set into partitions, while the `ORDER BY` clause specifies the logical order of the rows within each partition.

The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` clause defines the window frame within which the `LAST_VALUE()` function operates. By default, it considers all preceding and current rows in the window frame.

## Applying LAST_VALUE in Data Migration

To leverage the `LAST_VALUE()` function in a data migration scenario, you can use it within a SQL statement to extract the last value from the source table and insert it into the destination table.

Let's consider an example where we have a source table called `employees` with columns `employee_id` and `last_name`, and we want to migrate the data to a destination table called `employees_migration` with the same columns. We want to insert the last name of the employee as it was in the source table.

Here's how the SQL query would look like:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees_migration (employee_id, last_name)
SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, LAST_VALUE(last_name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY employee_id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS last_name
FROM employees;
```

In this example, the `LAST_VALUE()` function is used within a `SELECT` statement to return the last name of each employee in the source table. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only distinct `employee_id` values are inserted into the destination table.

By specifying `ORDER BY employee_id`, we guarantee that the last value is selected based on the ascending order of `employee_id`. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` clause includes all rows up to and including the current row in the window frame.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE()` function in SQL is a powerful tool for data migration scenarios when you need to extract the last value of a column from the source table and load it into the destination table. By understanding the syntax and how to apply it, you can efficiently and accurately transform and migrate your data. #SQL #DataMigration
