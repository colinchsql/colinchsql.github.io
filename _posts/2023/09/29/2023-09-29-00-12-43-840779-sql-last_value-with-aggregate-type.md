When working with SQL, there are many powerful functions available to manipulate and analyze data. One such function is `LAST_VALUE`, which can be particularly useful when dealing with aggregate types.

## What is LAST_VALUE?

The `LAST_VALUE` function is a window function in SQL that retrieves the value of a specified expression from the last row in an ordered or partitioned set of rows within a window frame. It is commonly used to find the last value in a column within a group or ordered set.

## Using the LAST_VALUE Function with Aggregate Types

By default, the `LAST_VALUE` function operates on scalar values, such as integers, strings, or dates. However, with the help of aggregate types, we can apply the `LAST_VALUE` function on more complex data structures like arrays and JSON objects.

Let's consider an example where we have a table `sales` with columns `product_id` of type `integer` and `sales_data` of type `jsonb`. Here, `sales_data` stores an array of JSON objects representing the daily sales data for each product.

To find the last value from the `sales_data` array for each product, we can use the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `agg` mode (aggregated mode) for aggregate types. The syntax for using the `LAST_VALUE` function with aggregate types is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ordering_expression) FILTER (WHERE condition) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expression ORDER BY ordering_expression)
```

Here is an example of how we can use it:

```sql
SELECT product_id, 
       LAST_VALUE(sales_data) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sales_date DESC) FILTER (WHERE sales_date <= current_date) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id) AS last_sales_data
FROM sales;
```

In this example, we are retrieving the last sales data for each product where the sales date is on or before the current date.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL is a powerful tool for retrieving the last value from a column within a window frame. By using the aggregate type mode, we can extend its functionality to work with more complex data structures like arrays and JSON objects. This allows for greater flexibility and analysis when working with aggregated data.

Make sure to leverage the `LAST_VALUE` function with aggregate types to gain valuable insights from your data and optimize your queries.
