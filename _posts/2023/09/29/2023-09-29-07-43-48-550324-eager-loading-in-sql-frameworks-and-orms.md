Eager loading is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to retrieve a collection of objects that have associated relationships. Without eager loading, the default behavior of most SQL frameworks and ORMs is to lazily load associated data, which means additional queries are executed as needed for each related object. This can lead to the notorious "N+1" problem, where the number of queries executed grows exponentially with the number of objects retrieved.

To illustrate how eager loading works, let's assume we have two database tables: `users` and `posts`. Each user can have multiple posts associated with them. In typical usage, querying for a list of users and their posts would result in multiple queries being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;

-- For each user, execute the following query:
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?
```

With eager loading, you can specify that the related `posts` should be loaded along with the initial `users` query. This can usually be achieved through the usage of specific keywords or methods provided by your chosen SQL framework or ORM. Here's an example using the popular Ruby ORM, ActiveRecord:

```ruby
users = User.includes(:posts) # Eager loading using `includes`
```

The resulting SQL executed by ActiveRecord, thanks to eager loading, would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (?);
```

By fetching the associated `posts` in just one additional query instead of multiple queries per user, eager loading effectively eliminates the N+1 queries problem and significantly reduces the overhead of data retrieval.

In summary, eager loading is a powerful optimization technique in SQL frameworks and ORMs that helps minimize database queries by fetching related data in advance. It is crucial for improving performance when working with complex data models and can result in substantial gains in query efficiency. By leveraging eager loading, you can ensure that your application operates efficiently even when dealing with large and interconnected datasets.
