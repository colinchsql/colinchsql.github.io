When working with SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, it is important to have a good understanding of stored procedures and functions. These database objects allow you to encapsulate sets of SQL statements into reusable blocks of code, which can then be called from your application.

In this article, we will explore the basics of working with stored procedures and functions in SQL ORM, focusing on how to execute them and handle the results.

## What are Stored Procedures and Functions?

Stored Procedures and Functions are precompiled database programs that are stored in the database itself. They can be written in SQL or procedural languages like PL/SQL or T-SQL, depending on the database platform you are using.

### Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are a collection of SQL statements that are compiled and stored on the database server. They can accept input parameters, perform operations on the database, and return results. Stored procedures are often used for complex data operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting records.

### Functions

Functions are similar to stored procedures, but they return a single value. They can be used within SQL queries and expressions, allowing you to perform calculations or transformations on the data. Functions can also accept input parameters.

## Executing Stored Procedures and Functions in SQL ORM

To execute a stored procedure or function in a SQL ORM framework, you typically use a combination of SQL statements and ORM-specific APIs. The exact approach may vary depending on the ORM framework you are using, but the general steps remain the same.

Here's an example using Python and the popular SQLAlchemy ORM:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create the database connection
engine = create_engine('your_database_url')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Define the stored procedure or function call
# Replace 'your_procedure_name' with the actual name of the stored procedure or function
sql_query = "CALL your_procedure_name()"

# Execute the stored procedure or function
result = session.execute(sql_query)

# Process the results
for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the database connection
session.close()
```

In this example, we first create a database connection using SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function. We then create a session object and execute the stored procedure or function using `session.execute`. Finally, we process the results returned by the database.

## Conclusion

Stored procedures and functions are powerful tools for encapsulating database logic and improving application performance. With the help of SQL ORM frameworks, executing stored procedures and functions becomes seamless and straightforward.

By understanding the basics of working with stored procedures and functions in SQL ORM, you can leverage their full potential and simplify your database interactions in your applications.
