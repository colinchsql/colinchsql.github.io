In today's fast-paced world, real-time data synchronization has become a crucial requirement for many applications. Whether you are building a messaging app, collaborative document editing tool, or any other application that involves multiple users interacting with the same data, keeping data synchronized in real-time is essential for a seamless user experience.

## What is SQL ORM?

SQL ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that allows developers to interact with the database using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. It provides a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and handle complex relationships between database tables.

## The Need for Real-time Data Synchronization

Traditionally, when multiple users interact with a shared dataset, changes made by one user have to be manually propagated to other users. This approach has several limitations:

1. **Latency**: There may be a delay between making changes and seeing them reflected in other users' screens, leading to a potential loss of information or confusion.
2. **Concurrency**: Handling simultaneous updates from multiple users can be complex, requiring careful synchronization to prevent conflicts or inconsistent data.
3. **Scalability**: As the number of users increases, the overhead of manual synchronization becomes impractical. 

## Real-time Data Synchronization Techniques

To achieve real-time data synchronization with SQL ORM, you can utilize the following techniques:

### 1. Database Triggers

Database triggers can be used to detect changes in the database and notify the application in real-time. Whenever a record is inserted, updated, or deleted, a trigger can send a notification to subscribed clients, allowing them to update their UI immediately. This technique provides near-instantaneous synchronization but requires support for triggers in the database system.

### 2. Change Data Capture (CDC)

Change Data Capture is a mechanism provided by databases to track changes made to specific tables. It captures the data modifications and stores them in a separate change log that can be queried to retrieve the changes. By monitoring the change log, the application can detect and apply the changes to keep the data synchronized across clients.

### 3. WebSockets

WebSockets provide a bidirectional communication channel between the client and the server, allowing real-time data updates. By integrating WebSockets into your SQL ORM-based application, you can notify connected clients whenever there are data changes and keep the UI synchronized in real-time. This technique provides a flexible and efficient way to handle real-time data updates.

## Conclusion

Real-time data synchronization is crucial for applications where multiple users interact with the same dataset simultaneously. By leveraging SQL ORM and techniques like database triggers, Change Data Capture, and WebSockets, you can achieve real-time data synchronization and provide a seamless user experience.
