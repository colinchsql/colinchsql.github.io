When dealing with SQL databases, efficient retrieval of data is essential for improved application performance. One technique that can significantly enhance the performance is **eager loading**. Let's dive into what eager loading is and how it can be implemented.

## What is Eager Loading?

Eager loading is a method to retrieve related data along with the main data in a single query, rather than executing separate queries for each relationship. It helps to reduce the number of database round-trips and minimize network overhead, resulting in faster data retrieval.

## Handling Data Deduplication

While eager loading enhances performance, it can also lead to the problem of data duplication. This occurs when multiple records of the main entity are loaded along with the associated entities. This redundancy can impact memory consumption and increase processing time.

To handle data deduplication, there are a couple of approaches you can take:

### 1. Distinct Keyword

One way to tackle data duplication is by using the `DISTINCT` keyword in your SQL query. This ensures that only unique records are returned, eliminating any duplicate entries. For example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT users.id, users.name, addresses.street
FROM users
JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id;
```

### 2. Group By

Another approach is to use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the main entity records by their unique identifiers. This way, duplicate records are grouped together, and you can select only one record per group. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT users.id, users.name, MAX(addresses.street)
FROM users
JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id
GROUP BY users.id, users.name;
```

In this example, the `MAX` function is used to retrieve a single value from each group for the `addresses.street` column.

## Conclusion

Eager loading is a powerful technique for optimizing data retrieval in SQL databases and improving application performance. However, it's crucial to handle data deduplication to prevent redundancy and maintain the efficiency of your database queries. By using the `DISTINCT` keyword or the `GROUP BY` clause, you can effectively deduplicate your data and maximize the benefits of eager loading.
