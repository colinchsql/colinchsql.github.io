In this blog post, we will explore the usage of the **LAST_VALUE** function in SQL along with the **SAVEPOINT** statement. These powerful features allow us to extract the last non-null value in a result set and to create savepoints within a transaction, respectively. 

## The LAST_VALUE Function

The **LAST_VALUE** function is a window function in SQL that returns the last value of a specific column within a group of rows. It is often used in conjunction with the **PARTITION BY** clause to define the grouping of rows.

Here is an example of using the **LAST_VALUE** function:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY employee_id) as last_salary
FROM employees;
```

In the above query, we select the employee ID, department ID, salary, and the last salary within each department. The **LAST_VALUE** function is applied over the partition defined by **department_id** and ordered by **employee_id**.

## The SAVEPOINT Statement

The **SAVEPOINT** statement is used to mark a specific point within a transaction to which we can later rollback if needed. This is useful in scenarios where we want to perform multiple operations and rollback only a part of the transaction without undoing the entire transaction.

Here is an example of using the **SAVEPOINT** statement:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, salary)
VALUES (1001, 10, 5000);

SAVEPOINT before_update;

UPDATE employees
SET salary = 6000
WHERE employee_id = 1001;

SAVEPOINT after_update;

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1002;

ROLLBACK TO before_update;

COMMIT;
```
In the above transaction, we first insert a new employee record with an ID of 1001 and a department ID of 10. We then create a savepoint named "before_update". 

Next, we update the salary of employee 1001 and create another savepoint called "after_update". Finally, we delete the record of employee 1002.

If we decide to rollback the transaction, we can use the **ROLLBACK TO** statement to rollback to the "before_update" savepoint. This will undo the update and deletion, but retain the insertion of employee 1001.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored the usage of the **LAST_VALUE** function and the **SAVEPOINT** statement in SQL. By utilizing these features, we can retrieve the last non-null value in a result set and create savepoints within a transaction. These functionalities enhance the power and flexibility of SQL, allowing for more precise data manipulation and control. #SQL #WindowFunctions #Transactions
