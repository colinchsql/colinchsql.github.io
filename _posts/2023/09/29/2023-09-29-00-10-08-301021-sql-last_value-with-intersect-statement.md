In the world of data analysis and manipulation, SQL (Structured Query Language) plays a crucial role. SQL provides a powerful set of functions that enable us to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. One such powerful function is LAST_VALUE, which, when coupled with the INTERSECT statement, can unlock new possibilities in data analysis.

## Understanding the LAST_VALUE Function

The LAST_VALUE function in SQL allows us to retrieve the last value in an ordered set of data. It is especially useful in situations where we need to find the most recent value in a time series or any other ordered sequence of data. The LAST_VALUE function syntax is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE (expression) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expression ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC] 
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

- `expression`: The column or expression for which we want to find the last value.
- `partition_expression`: The column used for partitioning the data.
- `sort_expression`: The column used for ordering the data.
- `ASC | DESC`: Specifies the sort order. By default, it is set to ASC (ascending).
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Specifies the range of rows to consider.

## Leveraging LAST_VALUE with INTERSECT Statement

The INTERSECT statement in SQL allows us to retrieve the common rows between two or more queries. Combining the INTERSECT statement with the LAST_VALUE function can provide us with valuable insights by considering only the last value of common rows from multiple queries.

Let's consider an example scenario where we have two tables, `table1` and `table2`, both containing a `product_id` column and a `price` column. We want to find the last recorded price for the common product IDs in both tables. Here's how we can achieve that using the LAST_VALUE function and the INTERSECT statement:

```sql
SELECT product_id, LAST_VALUE(price) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY timestamp_column DESC)
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, price, timestamp_column
    FROM table1
    INTERSECT
    SELECT product_id, price, timestamp_column
    FROM table2
) AS common_products;
```

In this example, we first retrieve the common rows from `table1` and `table2` using the `INTERSECT` statement. Then, we use the `LAST_VALUE` function to select the last recorded price for each common product ID, ordered in descending order based on the `timestamp_column`.

By combining the power of the `LAST_VALUE` function and the `INTERSECT` statement, we can efficiently analyze and compare data from multiple tables or queries.
