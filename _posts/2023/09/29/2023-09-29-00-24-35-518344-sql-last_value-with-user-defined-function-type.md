In SQL, the LAST_VALUE function is commonly used to retrieve the last value within an ordered set of rows. However, its usage is limited when it comes to working with user-defined functions. This blog post will explain how to use the LAST_VALUE function with a user-defined function type, providing you with a practical example.

## Understanding the LAST_VALUE Function

The LAST_VALUE function is a window function in SQL that allows you to retrieve the last value of an expression within a specified window. It operates on a set of rows defined by the window clause.

Here's the basic syntax of the LAST_VALUE function:

```
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
  [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...]
  [ROWS {CURRENT ROW | value_expression PRECEDING | value_expression FOLLOWING}]
)
```

## Using LAST_VALUE with User-Defined Function Type

In some cases, you may want to apply the LAST_VALUE function to a user-defined function (UDF) type rather than a simple expression. However, by default, the LAST_VALUE function does not work with UDF types.

To overcome this limitation, you can convert the UDF type to a built-in function type by using a common table expression (CTE). Here's an example to illustrate this concept.

Let's assume we have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

Suppose we have a UDF named `calculate_bonus` that accepts an employee's salary and returns their bonus amount. We want to find the last bonus amount using the LAST_VALUE function.

To achieve this, we can use a CTE to convert the UDF type to a built-in function type:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT id, name, salary, calculate_bonus(salary) AS bonus
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY id
)
SELECT id, name, salary, LAST_VALUE(bonus) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS last_bonus
FROM cte;
```

In the above example, we created a CTE named `cte` and applied the UDF `calculate_bonus` to the `salary` column. Then, we used the LAST_VALUE function to retrieve the last bonus amount for each employee based on the `id` column.

## Conclusion

While the LAST_VALUE function may not directly work with user-defined function types, you can use a common table expression (CTE) to convert the UDF type to a built-in function type. This allows you to utilize the power of the LAST_VALUE function in combination with your user-defined functions. Happy coding!
