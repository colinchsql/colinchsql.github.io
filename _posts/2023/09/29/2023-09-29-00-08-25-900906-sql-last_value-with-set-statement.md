In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to fetch the last value in a series of values within a specific partition and order. It can be particularly useful when used alongside the `SET` statement to update a column with the last value from a certain order.

Here's an example of how to use `LAST_VALUE` with a `SET` statement in SQL:

```sql
UPDATE your_table
SET column_name = 
  (SELECT LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)
   FROM your_table);
```

Let's break down the above SQL statement:

1. The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify data in the specified table `your_table`.
2. The `SET` statement assigns a new value to the `column_name` column.
3. The subquery `(SELECT LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column) FROM your_table)` selects the last value from the `column_name` column using the `LAST_VALUE` function.
   
   - `LAST_VALUE(column_name)` selects the last value of the `column_name`.
   - `OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)` defines the partition and order criteria for the `LAST_VALUE` function.
     - `PARTITION BY` divides the rows into different partitions based on the values of the `partition_column`.
     - `ORDER BY` specifies the column used for ordering the rows within each partition. The last value will be determined based on this order.
   - `FROM your_table` specifies the table from which the column value is being selected.

By executing this SQL statement, the `column_name` column in the `your_table` table will be updated with the last value from the specified partition and order.

Remember to replace `your_table` with the actual name of the table, `column_name` with the specific column name you want to update, `partition_column` with the column used for partitioning, and `order_column` with the column used for ordering the rows.

By using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `SET` statement, you can easily update a column with the last value from a specific order within a partition. This can be handy when you want to update records with valuable information without manually specifying the values yourself.
