When working with relational databases, there are two common strategies for fetching associated data: eager loading and lazy loading. These strategies determine when and how the data is retrieved, and can have a significant impact on the performance and efficiency of your application. 

## Eager Loading
Eager loading, as the name suggests, loads all the associated data upfront. This means that when you query a particular record, the database retrieves not only the main record but also all of its related records.

Eager loading is beneficial in scenarios where you know in advance that you will need the associated data. It reduces the number of database queries needed and can prevent the common issue of N+1 queries, where N is the number of main records.

#### Example Eager Loading Code (using SQL)

```sql
SELECT customers.*, orders.*
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.id = 1;
```

In the above example, we retrieve a specific customer and all their associated orders in a single query using a join. This avoids making multiple queries to fetch each order individually.

## Lazy Loading
Lazy loading, on the other hand, defers the loading of associated data until it is specifically requested. When you query a record, only the main data is initially loaded. The associated data is loaded on-demand when accessed within the application.

Lazy loading is particularly useful when dealing with large databases or when the associated data is not always needed. It allows for quicker initial loading and reduces memory consumption.

#### Example Lazy Loading Code (using SQL)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;
```

Then, later in the application, when we need to retrieve the associated orders for the customer:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

In this case, we first fetch the customer record and then, when required, fetch the associated orders separately.

## Which Strategy to Choose?
The choice between eager loading and lazy loading depends on the specific requirements and usage patterns of your application.

- Use eager loading when you know in advance that you will need the associated data and want to minimize the number of queries.
- Use lazy loading when the associated data is not always needed or when dealing with large datasets that would be impractical to load all at once.

By understanding the differences between eager loading and lazy loading, you can make informed decisions when designing your database queries for optimal performance.
