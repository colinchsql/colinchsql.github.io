In the world of software development, database schema changes are inevitable. As our applications evolve and requirements change, it becomes necessary to modify the structure of our databases. However, managing these schema changes can be a daunting task.

One way to handle database schema changes is by using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that supports SQL. ORMs abstract away the underlying database implementation, making it easier to work with databases using programming language objects rather than raw SQL queries.

Let's explore how you can handle database schema changes using an SQL ORM, step-by-step:

## 1. Create Database Tables

When starting a new project, your ORM library typically provides a way to define your database schema using code instead of executing SQL statements. For example, with SQLAlchemy, a popular Python ORM library, you can define your tables as Python classes and their attributes as columns.

## 2. Make Schema Changes

Once you have your initial database schema defined, it's likely that you will need to make changes over time. Whether it's adding a new column, modifying an existing column, or creating a new table, an SQL ORM can help you handle these changes efficiently.

To make a schema change, you will usually need to write a migration script. This script defines the necessary SQL statements to alter the existing schema. Some ORM libraries provide tools that can generate these migration scripts automatically based on the changes made to your code-defined schema.

## 3. Apply Migrations

After creating a migration script, you can apply it to your database using the ORM library's migration tool. This tool will execute the required SQL statements to bring your database schema up to date. It may also keep track of which migrations have been applied, allowing you to migrate forward or backward easily.

## 4. Handling Data Migrations

When modifying database schema, it's crucial to consider any associated data changes. For example, if you add a new column, you may need to provide a default value or backfill existing records. The ORM library often provides ways to handle data migrations alongside schema migrations, ensuring data consistency.

## Summary

Using an SQL ORM to handle database schema changes can greatly simplify the process. It allows you to define and modify your database schema using programming language code, rather than relying solely on SQL queries. With the help of migration tools, you can apply schema changes and handle associated data migrations smoothly.

By adopting an ORM approach, you can maintain a clear and structured database schema while keeping your codebase in sync with the evolving requirements.
