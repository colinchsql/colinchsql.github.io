Data aggregations are a fundamental part of analyzing large datasets in various applications. Whether you are working with financial data, e-commerce statistics, or user activity tracking, being able to perform complex aggregations efficiently is crucial. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement complex data aggregations using SQL Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python.

SQL ORM libraries, such as SQLAlchemy, provide an abstraction layer over SQL databases, allowing you to interact with the database using Python objects and methods. This makes it easier to construct complex SQL queries and handle the result sets.

## 1. Understanding the Data Model

Before we dive into complex aggregations, let's understand the data model we are working with. Let's assume we have a database table called `orders`, which contains information about customer orders, including the order ID, customer ID, order date, and order amount.

```python
class Order(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    customer_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('customers.id'))
    order_date = Column(Date)
    order_amount = Column(Float)
```

## 2. Simple Aggregations

To start with, let's perform some simple aggregations using SQL ORM. We can use functions like `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, etc., to calculate various statistics. Here's an example of calculating the total number of orders:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

total_orders = session.query(func.count(Order.id)).scalar()
print(f"Total Orders: {total_orders}")
```

## 3. Grouping and Aggregating

Now, let's move on to more complex aggregations by using grouping and aggregating functions together. For example, let's calculate the total order amount for each customer:

```python
customer_order_amounts = session.query(
    Order.customer_id,
    func.sum(Order.order_amount)
).group_by(Order.customer_id).all()

for customer_id, order_amount in customer_order_amounts:
    print(f"Customer {customer_id}: {order_amount}")
```

In the above example, we group the orders by the `customer_id` and calculate the sum of the `order_amount` for each group.

## 4. Filtering Aggregations

We can also apply filters to our aggregations to calculate statistics for specific subsets of data. For instance, let's calculate the average order amount for orders placed in the last month:

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

last_month = date.today() - timedelta(days=30)

average_order_amount = session.query(
    func.avg(Order.order_amount)
).filter(Order.order_date >= last_month).scalar()

print(f"Average Order Amount (Last Month): {average_order_amount}")
```

In the above example, we filter the orders based on the order date and calculate the average order amount using the `avg()` function.

## Conclusion

Implementing complex data aggregations with SQL ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy provides a powerful way to analyze large datasets using Python. We explored simple and complex aggregations, including grouping, filtering, and applying various aggregation functions. By leveraging the power of SQL ORM, you can gain valuable insights from your data and make informed business decisions.
