In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value of an expression for each row within a window frame. It is often used in combination with string functions to perform operations on the last value of a string within a group of rows. This can be helpful in various scenarios such as finding the last occurrence of a character or extracting a specific substring from the last value.

Let's explore some examples of using `LAST_VALUE` with string functions.

## Example 1: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Character

Suppose we have a table called `employees` with a column called `name` that contains the full names of employees. We want to find the position of the last occurrence of the letter 'e' in each name.

```sql
SELECT name, 
    LAST_VALUE(LOCATE('e', name)) OVER (ORDER BY name) AS last_occurrence_of_e
FROM employees;
```

In this example, we use the string function `LOCATE` to find the position of 'e' in each name. The `LAST_VALUE` function then retrieves the last occurrence of 'e' within the window frame defined by the `ORDER BY` clause. The result will be a table with two columns: `name` and `last_occurrence_of_e`.

## Example 2: Extracting a Substring from the Last Value

Let's suppose we have a table called `messages` with a column called `message` that contains text messages. We want to extract the last five characters from each message.

```sql
SELECT message, 
    LAST_VALUE(SUBSTRING(message, -5)) OVER (ORDER BY message) AS last_five_characters
FROM messages;
```

In this example, we use the string function `SUBSTRING` to extract the last five characters from each message. By providing a negative number as the second argument to `SUBSTRING`, we ensure that the substring starts from the end of the message. The `LAST_VALUE` function retrieves the last substring within the window frame defined by the `ORDER BY` clause. The result will be a table with two columns: `message` and `last_five_characters`.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function combined with string functions can be a powerful tool when working with string data in SQL. It allows us to perform operations on the last value within a group of rows, giving us more flexibility and control in our queries.
