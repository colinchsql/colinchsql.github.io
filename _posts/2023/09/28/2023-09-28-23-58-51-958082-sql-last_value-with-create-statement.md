In SQL, `LAST_VALUE` is a window function that returns the last value in an ordered set of rows. It can be useful when you want to retrieve the last value in a column or perform calculations based on the last value.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function with a `CREATE` statement to create a new table in SQL.

## Syntax
The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` with a `CREATE` statement is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT column1, column2, LAST_VALUE(column3) OVER (ORDER BY column4) AS last_value_column
FROM existing_table;
```

Let's break down the syntax:

- `CREATE TABLE new_table`: This is the `CREATE` statement to create a new table named `new_table`.
- `AS SELECT`: This specifies that the data for the new table will be selected from an existing table.
- `column1, column2`: These are the columns from the existing table that you want to include in the new table.
- `LAST_VALUE(column3) OVER (ORDER BY column4) AS last_value_column`: This is where the `LAST_VALUE` function is used. It retrieves the last value of `column3` by ordering the rows based on `column4`.
- `FROM existing_table`: This specifies the existing table from which to select the data.

## Example

Let's consider an example to understand how to use `LAST_VALUE` with a `CREATE` statement.

Suppose we have an existing table named `sales` with the following structure:

| order_id | product_name | quantity | order_date  |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 1        | Product A    | 10       | 2022-01-01  |
| 2        | Product B    | 5        | 2022-01-02  |
| 3        | Product C    | 8        | 2022-01-03  |
| 4        | Product D    | 12       | 2022-01-04  |

We want to create a new table named `last_order` that includes the `order_id`, `product_name`, and the last value of the `quantity` column, based on the ascending order of `order_date`.

The SQL code to achieve this would be:

```sql
CREATE TABLE last_order AS
SELECT order_id, product_name, LAST_VALUE(quantity) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS last_quantity
FROM sales;
```

After executing this code, the `last_order` table would be created with the following data:

| order_id | product_name | last_quantity |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1        | Product A    | 12            |
| 2        | Product B    | 12            |
| 3        | Product C    | 12            |
| 4        | Product D    | 12            |

As you can see, the `last_quantity` column in the `last_order` table contains the last value of the `quantity` column from the `sales` table.

## Conclusion
Using the `LAST_VALUE` function with a `CREATE` statement allows you to create a new table in SQL, including the last value of a specific column from an existing table. This can be helpful when you need to preserve the last value or perform calculations based on it.
