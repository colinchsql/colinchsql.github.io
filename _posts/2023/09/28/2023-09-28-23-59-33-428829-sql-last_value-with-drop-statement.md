In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL along with the `DROP` statement to efficiently retrieve the last value in a sequence and remove it from the table.

## What is LAST_VALUE Function?

The `LAST_VALUE` function is a window function in SQL that returns the last value in a sorted sequence. It is useful when you want to find the most recent or latest value in a group of rows.

## Using LAST_VALUE with DROP Statement

Suppose we have a table called `my_table` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  value VARCHAR(50)
);
```

We can use the `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `DROP` statement to retrieve and remove the last value from the `value` column. Here's an example query:

```sql
WITH last_row AS (
  SELECT
    value,
    LAST_VALUE(value) OVER (ORDER BY id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_value
  FROM
    my_table
)
DELETE FROM my_table
WHERE
  value = (SELECT last_value FROM last_row)
```

In the above query, we first create a CTE (Common Table Expression) named `last_row` which uses the `LAST_VALUE` function to select the last value from the `value` column and assigns it as `last_value`. The `ROW BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause ensures that the window range includes all rows.

We then use a delete statement to remove the row(s) from `my_table` where the `value` column matches the `last_value` selected from the CTE.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL along with the `DROP` statement to efficiently retrieve the last value in a sequence and remove it from the table. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to process the latest value and remove it from the dataset.
