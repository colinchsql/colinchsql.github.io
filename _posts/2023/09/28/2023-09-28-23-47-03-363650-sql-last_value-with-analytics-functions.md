In SQL, the LAST_VALUE function is used in conjunction with analytics functions to retrieve the last value in a group of rows within a partition. It is particularly useful when you want to find the last value based on an ordering or ranking criteria.

## Syntax

The syntax of the LAST_VALUE function varies slightly depending on the specific analytics function you are using. However, the general syntax is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_clause ORDER BY order_clause
                            ROWS BETWEEN start_row AND end_row)
```

- `expression`: The column or expression whose last value you want to retrieve.
- `PARTITION BY`: Specifies how to divide the result set into partitions. The `LAST_VALUE` function is applied within each partition separately.
- `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order in which the rows should be sorted. The `LAST_VALUE` function considers the ordering to determine the last value.
- `ROWS BETWEEN`: Defines the range of rows within each partition to consider while calculating the last value.

## Example

Let's consider a sample table named `orders` that stores customer orders with the following columns: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, and `order_date`. We want to find the last order date for each customer using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `MAX` analytics function.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, 
       LAST_VALUE(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id 
                                    ORDER BY order_date
                                    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
                                            AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_order_date
FROM orders;
```

In this example, we use the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `MAX` analytics function. We partition the result set by `customer_id` and order it by `order_date`. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause includes all the rows in the partition to compute the last value. The resulting query will retrieve the last order date for each customer.

## Conclusion

The SQL `LAST_VALUE` function with analytics functions allows you to find the last value within a specific partition based on an ordering criterion. It is a powerful tool for analyzing data in SQL and can be used in various scenarios. Keep in mind that the actual syntax and usage may vary depending on the specific database system you are working with. So always refer to your database documentation for accurate details.
