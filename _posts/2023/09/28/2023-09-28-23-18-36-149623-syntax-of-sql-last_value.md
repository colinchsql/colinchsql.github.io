SQL, or Structured Query Language, provides a variety of functions to manipulate and retrieve data from databases. One such function is `LAST_VALUE`, which allows you to access the last value in a specified column within a partition.

The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` in SQL is as follows:

```
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expression ORDER BY sort_expression [ROWS row_or_range_frame])
```

Let's break down the different parts of the syntax:

- `column_name`: This is the name of the column from which you want to retrieve the last value.
- `PARTITION BY`: This clause is optional and allows you to specify the column or expression by which you want to partition the result set.
- `partition_expression`: This is the column or expression used for partitioning the data. The result set is divided based on the unique values of this expression.
- `ORDER BY`: This clause is mandatory and is used to specify the column or expression used for sorting the data within each partition.
- `sort_expression`: This is the column or expression used to order the data within each partition. The last value will be determined based on this ordering.
- `ROWS`: This clause is optional and is used to define a frame within which the function should operate.
- `row_or_range_frame`: This specifies the number of rows or a range of rows within the partition to consider for calculating the last value.

Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of `LAST_VALUE`:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, last_name, hire_date, LAST_VALUE(hire_date) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS last_hire_date
FROM employees;
```

In this example, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last hire date for each employee from the `employees` table. The result set will include the employee ID, last name, hire date, and the last hire date as a separate column.

Using `LAST_VALUE` can be helpful in scenarios where you need to access the most recent value in a column or find the latest records within each partition.
