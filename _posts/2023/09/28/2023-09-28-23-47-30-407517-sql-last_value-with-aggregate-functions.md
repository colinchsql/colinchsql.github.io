In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is commonly used to return the last value in an ordered set of values. However, when used in conjunction with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, or `AVG`, the behavior of `LAST_VALUE` may not be intuitive. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `LAST_VALUE` with aggregate functions and discuss some important considerations.

## Syntax
The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` with aggregate functions is as follows:

```
SELECT 
   aggregate_function(LAST_VALUE(column) 
   OVER (ORDER BY column 
   ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)) 
FROM 
   table_name
```

## Example

Let's consider a sample table called `sales` with the following columns: `product_name`, `date`, and `quantity_sold`. We want to calculate the total quantity sold for each product, but also display the last quantity sold for each product.

```sql
SELECT
   product_name,
   SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold,
   LAST_VALUE(quantity_sold) 
      OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY date 
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 
      UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_quantity_sold
FROM
   sales
GROUP BY
   product_name;
```

In the above example, we use the `PARTITION BY` clause to partition the data by the `product_name` column. This ensures that the `LAST_VALUE` function is applied separately for each product. We then use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the rows within each partition by the `date` column. Finally, we calculate the `SUM` of the `quantity_sold` column and select the `LAST_VALUE` of `quantity_sold` for each product.

## Considerations

When using `LAST_VALUE` with aggregate functions, it is important to consider the window frame clause. In the example above, we used the clause `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`, which includes all rows within the partition. However, you can customize the window frame to include only a subset of rows if desired.

Another consideration is the performance impact of using `LAST_VALUE` with aggregate functions. Depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the query, it may have an impact on query execution time. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of your query and consider indexing or other optimization techniques if necessary.
