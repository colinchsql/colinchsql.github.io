In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value in a sequence of rows, based on a specified order. This function can be especially useful when combined with a `JOIN` clause, allowing us to retrieve relevant information from multiple tables.

## Syntax

The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` with a `JOIN` clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.columnX = table2.columnY
WHERE <condition>
ORDER BY columnZ
OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)
```
Here, `table1` and `table2` represent the two tables being joined, `columnX` and `columnY` are the columns used for joining the tables, `<condition>` specifies any additional filtering criteria, and `columnZ` is the column used for ordering the result set.

## Example

Consider two tables: `orders` and `customers`. We want to retrieve the last order placed by each customer, along with customer details. Here's an example using the `LAST_VALUE` function with a `JOIN` clause:

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date,
           LAST_VALUE(order_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS last_order_id
    FROM orders
) AS last_orders ON customers.customer_id = last_orders.customer_id AND orders.order_id = last_orders.last_order_id
```

In this example, we first select the `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and the last order_id using the `LAST_VALUE` function within a subquery. Then, we perform the `JOIN` between the `customers` table and the subquery results, matching on the `customer_id` and `last_order_id` columns.

By using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `JOIN` clause, we can easily retrieve the last order placed by each customer, along with the corresponding customer details.
