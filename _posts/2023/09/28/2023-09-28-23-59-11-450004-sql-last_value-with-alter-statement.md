In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value of an expression within a specified order range. This function can be combined with the `ALTER` statement to update a column with the last value from a specific column.

Let's say we have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   salary INT
);
```

Now, let's assume we want to update the `salary` column with the last recorded salary of each employee. We can achieve this using the `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `ALTER` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
   ALTER COLUMN salary 
   SET DEFAULT LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (ORDER BY id);
```

In the above example, we are using the `LAST_VALUE(salary)` function to retrieve the last recorded value from the `salary` column. The `OVER` clause is used to specify the order in which the values should be evaluated. In this case, we are ordering by the `id` column. Finally, we set this value as the default value for the `salary` column using the `SET DEFAULT` clause.

By utilizing the `LAST_VALUE` function in combination with the `ALTER` statement, we can easily update a column with the last recorded value from another column.

# Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL provides a convenient way to retrieve the last value within a specified range. When combined with the `ALTER` statement, we can update a column with the last value from another column efficiently. This technique can be useful in scenarios where we need to maintain the most recent value automatically in a column. Hashtag: #SQL #LAST_VALUE
