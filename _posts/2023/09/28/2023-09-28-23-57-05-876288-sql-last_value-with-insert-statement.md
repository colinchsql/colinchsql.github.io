In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is commonly used to return the last value in a rowset. It is often used with the `OVER` clause to specify the partition and order in which the function should operate. However, using `LAST_VALUE` with an `INSERT` statement can be a bit tricky.

Let's consider a scenario where we have a table called `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. We want to insert a new employee record and set the `employee_id` to the next sequential value, based on the maximum `employee_id` in the existing records.

Here's an example of how we can achieve this using the `LAST_VALUE` function with an `INSERT` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (
    (SELECT LAST_VALUE(employee_id) OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) + 1
     FROM employees),
    'John',
    'Doe'
);
```

In this example, we are using `LAST_VALUE` to retrieve the maximum `employee_id` using the `OVER` clause. We then add 1 to this value to get the next sequential value for the new employee. Finally, we use this calculated value in the `VALUES` clause of the `INSERT` statement along with the other column values.

Keep in mind that the use of `LAST_VALUE` in this way assumes that the `employee_id` column is sequentially increasing. If there are gaps or irregularities in the sequence, this method may produce unexpected results. In such cases, alternative methods like sequences or triggers may be more suitable.

Remember to adapt this example to match your specific database system, as syntax and specific functions may vary.

By using the `LAST_VALUE` function with an `INSERT` statement, you can easily insert new records with sequentially increasing values for a particular column.
