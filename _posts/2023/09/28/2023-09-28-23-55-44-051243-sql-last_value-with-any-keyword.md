In SQL, the LAST_VALUE function is used to retrieve the last value in a given dataset. It can be particularly useful when combined with the ANY keyword to filter the result based on a specific condition. This combination allows you to retrieve the last value that satisfies a given condition.

## Syntax
The general syntax for using the LAST_VALUE function with the ANY keyword is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    ORDER BY order_expression
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) = ANY (SELECT condition)
```

- `column_name` is the column from which you want to retrieve the last value.
- `partition_expression` (optional) divides the result set into partitions.
- `order_expression` specifies the ordering used to determine the last value.
- `condition` is the condition used to filter the result set using the ANY keyword.

## Example
Let's consider a sample table called `products` with the following structure and data:

| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | Laptop       | 1000  |
| 2          | Phone        | 800   |
| 3          | Laptop       | 1200  |
| 4          | Phone        | 900   |
| 5          | Tablet       | 500   |

Now, suppose we want to find the last price of any product with the name "Laptop". We can use the LAST_VALUE function with the ANY keyword to achieve this.

```sql
SELECT product_name, LAST_VALUE(price) OVER (
    ORDER BY product_id
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) = ANY (SELECT price FROM products WHERE product_name = 'Laptop') AS is_last_laptop_price
FROM products
WHERE product_name = 'Laptop'
```

In the above example, we select the product name and use the LAST_VALUE function with the ANY keyword to compare the price with the last value of the `price` column for products with the name "Laptop". The result will be a boolean value indicating if the price is the last price for laptops.

## Conclusion
By combining the LAST_VALUE function with the ANY keyword, you can retrieve the last value that satisfies a specific condition in SQL. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to find the last relevant information in your dataset.
