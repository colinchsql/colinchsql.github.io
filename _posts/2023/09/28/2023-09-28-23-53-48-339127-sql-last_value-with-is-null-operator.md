When working with SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function can be extremely useful for retrieving the last value in a specified window partition. In combination with the `IS NULL` operator, you can leverage this function to filter for specific conditions based on the last value returned.

## Syntax of LAST_VALUE Function
The `LAST_VALUE` function is typically used in conjunction with the `OVER` clause to specify the window partition for which the last value should be determined. The basic syntax of the `LAST_VALUE` function is as follows:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
  [ORDER BY column_name [ASC | DESC]]
)
```

## Using the LAST_VALUE Function with IS NULL Operator
To filter for records where the last value of a particular column is `NULL`, you can combine the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `IS NULL` operator. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM (
  SELECT column_name,
         LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY sorting_column) AS last_value
  FROM table_name
) AS subquery
WHERE last_value IS NULL;
```

In the above example, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value of `column_name` within each window partition defined by `partition_column`, and the result is assigned as `last_value`. The outer query then filters the records where `last_value` is `NULL`.

## Example Usage
Let's consider a scenario where we have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `name`, `salary`, and `department`. We want to find the department(s) where the last recorded salary is `NULL`. Here's how the query would look like:

```sql
SELECT department
FROM (
  SELECT department,
         LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY employee_id) AS last_salary
  FROM employees
) AS subquery
WHERE last_salary IS NULL;
```

In this example, we first use the `LAST_VALUE` function to determine the last recorded salary for each department, ordered by `employee_id`. The outer query then filters the records where `last_salary` is `NULL`, giving us the department(s) where the last recorded salary is missing.

## Conclusion
The combination of the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `IS NULL` operator provides a convenient way to extract records where the last value in a window partition meets a certain condition. By leveraging this functionality in SQL, you can perform more specialized analysis and filtering in your queries.
