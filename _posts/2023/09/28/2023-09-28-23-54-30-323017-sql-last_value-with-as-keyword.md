SQL is a powerful language for managing and manipulating data within relational databases. One useful SQL function is `LAST_VALUE`, which allows us to retrieve the last value in a given column. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function and how to combine it with the `AS` keyword for more meaningful results.

## Syntax of the LAST_VALUE Function

The `LAST_VALUE` function is used to return the last value in a specified column. Here is the basic syntax:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY order_column ASC/DESC)
```

- `column_name` is the name of the column from which we want to retrieve the last value.
- `order_column` is the column used to determine the order of the data.

## Example Usage

Consider the following `orders` table:

| order_id | customer | amount |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1        | John     | 100    |
| 2        | Jane     | 200    |
| 3        | John     | 150    |
| 4        | Jane     | 250    |

Now, let's say we want to find the last order amount for each customer. We can use the `LAST_VALUE` function to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  customer,
  LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY order_id ASC) AS last_order_amount
FROM
  orders;
```

In the above example, we're using the `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause to specify that the calculation should be performed partitioned by the `customer` column and ordered by the `order_id` column.

The result of the query will be:

| customer | last_order_amount |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| John     | 150              |
| Jane     | 250              |

Here, we see that the `LAST_VALUE` function returns the last order amount for each customer.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL provides a convenient way to retrieve the last value in a given column. By combining it with the `AS` keyword, we can assign meaningful names to the calculated results. This allows for more readable and informative queries. So the next time you need to find the last value in a column, give the `LAST_VALUE` function a try!
