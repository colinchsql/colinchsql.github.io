In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to return the last value in a group of rows. It is part of the window function family and can be particularly useful when you want to find the last occurrence of a specific data point within a group or partition.

To use `LAST_VALUE`, you'll need to specify the column you want to retrieve the last value from within the window frame. You also need to define the window frame using the `OVER` clause.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how to use `LAST_VALUE`:

```sql
SELECT product_id, order_date,
  LAST_VALUE(price) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date
                          ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_price
FROM sales;
```

In this example, we have a table named `sales` with columns `product_id`, `order_date`, and `price`. We want to find the last price of each product within their respective order dates.

The `OVER` clause partitions the data by `product_id` and orders it by `order_date`. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` specifies the window frame as all rows within each partition.

The result set will include the `product_id`, `order_date`, and `last_price` columns. The `last_price` column will display the last price of each product within the defined window frame.

Remember to adapt the example code to your specific database schema and column names.

In summary, by utilizing the SQL `LAST_VALUE` function along with the `OVER` clause, you can easily retrieve the last value within a group of rows based on your specified criteria. This can be very useful when analyzing time-series data or tracking the latest data point for each category.
