In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value of an expression within a specified window frame. It is often used in combination with mathematical functions to perform calculations on the last value in a set of rows.

Let's explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function with mathematical functions in SQL.

## Syntax

The syntax for using `LAST_VALUE` with mathematical functions is as follows:

```
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column [ROWS frame_spec])
```

- `expression` represents the column or expression on which the mathematical function will be performed.
- `PARTITION BY` is an optional clause that divides the rows into partitions based on a column.
- `ORDER BY` specifies the column used for ordering the rows within each partition.
- `ROWS frame_spec` defines the range of rows over which the mathematical function will be evaluated.

## Example

Let's consider a table called `sales` with the following structure:

| id | product | quantity | price |
|----|---------|----------|-------|
| 1  | A       | 10       | 5     |
| 2  | B       | 20       | 10    |
| 3  | A       | 15       | 3     |
| 4  | B       | 25       | 8     |
| 5  | A       | 5        | 2     |

Suppose we want to calculate the total sales amount for each `product`, using the `LAST_VALUE` function with the `quantity` and `price` columns.

```sql
SELECT product, LAST_VALUE(quantity * price) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY id) AS total_sales
FROM sales;
```

The above query will give us the following result:

| product | total_sales |
|---------|-------------|
| A       | 75          |
| A       | 90          |
| A       | 10          |
| B       | 200         |
| B       | 200         |

In this example, the `LAST_VALUE` function calculates the product of `quantity` and `price` for each row, ordered by the `id` column. The result is then displayed for each `product`, giving us the total sales amount for each product considering the last value within each partition.

By using the `LAST_VALUE` function in combination with mathematical functions, we can perform calculations on the last value within a specified window frame, enabling more advanced data analysis in SQL queries.
