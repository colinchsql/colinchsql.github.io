The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL is a powerful analytic function that allows you to easily retrieve the last value in a specific column within a group of rows. It can be used to find the latest record, the most recent value, or to compare the current row with the last row in a partition.

## Syntax

The `LAST_VALUE` function has the following syntax:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ...
    [ROWS BETWEEN <window-frame> PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW]
)
```

- `expression`: The column or expression used to determine the last value.
- `PARTITION BY`: Optional clause that divides the result set into partitions based on one or more columns.
- `ORDER BY`: Defines the order in which the rows within each partition will be evaluated.
- `ROWS BETWEEN <window-frame> PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Optional clause that defines the range of rows to consider within each partition.

## Example

Let's consider a table named `sales` with the following structure:

| OrderID | ProductName | Quantity | OrderDate  |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1       | Product A   | 10       | 2021-01-01 |
| 2       | Product B   | 5        | 2021-01-02 |
| 3       | Product A   | 7        | 2021-01-03 |
| 4       | Product C   | 12       | 2021-01-04 |
| 5       | Product B   | 8        | 2021-01-05 |

If we want to find the last order date for each product, we can use the `LAST_VALUE` function:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    ProductName,
    LAST_VALUE(OrderDate) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ProductName
        ORDER BY OrderDate
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS LastOrderDate
FROM
    sales;
```

This query will return the following result:

| ProductName | LastOrderDate |
|-------------|---------------|
| Product A   | 2021-01-03    |
| Product B   | 2021-01-05    |
| Product C   | 2021-01-04    |

In this example, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last order date for each product by ordering the rows by `OrderDate` within each partition of `ProductName`.
