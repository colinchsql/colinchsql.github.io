In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function allows us to access the last value in a set of ordered rows within a partition. By default, this function returns the last non-null value. However, there may be scenarios where we want to consider `NULL` values as the most recent, and order them at the beginning of the result set. In such cases, we can leverage the `NULLS FIRST` option with the `LAST_VALUE` function.

Here's an example query that demonstrates the usage of `LAST_VALUE` with `NULLS FIRST`:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
    LAST_VALUE(column3) 
         OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
         NULLS FIRST) AS last_value_with_nulls_first
FROM your_table;
```

In the above query, we retrieve values from `column1`, `column2`, and apply the `LAST_VALUE` function on `column3`. Sorting is done within each partition defined by `column1`, ordering the rows by `column2` in ascending or descending order. By adding `NULLS FIRST` at the end of the `ORDER BY` clause, `NULL` values will be considered the "last" values within the partition.

It's important to note that the `NULLS FIRST` option is not supported in all database systems. So, be sure to consult your SQL database documentation to ensure compatibility.

With the `LAST_VALUE` function and the `NULLS FIRST` option, you can conveniently handle scenarios where treating `NULL` values as the most recent is crucial for your analysis or application.
