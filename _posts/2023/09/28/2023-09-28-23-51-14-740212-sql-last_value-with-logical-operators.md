In SQL, the LAST_VALUE function is used to retrieve the last value within a group of rows. It can be quite useful when working with ordered data and you need to access the last value based on certain criteria. In addition to using the LAST_VALUE function alone, you can also combine it with logical operators to further refine your query results.

Let's say we have a table called `sales` with the following columns: `product_name`, `date`, `quantity_sold`. We want to find the last value of `quantity_sold` for each product where the quantity is greater than 100. We can use the LAST_VALUE function along with a logical operator to accomplish this.

Here's an example query using the `LAST_VALUE` function with a logical operator:

```sql
SELECT product_name, 
       LAST_VALUE(quantity_sold) 
           OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY date 
                 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_quantity_sold
FROM sales
WHERE quantity_sold > 100;
```

In this query, we use the `LAST_VALUE` function within the windowing clause of the `OVER` keyword. The `PARTITION BY` clause ensures that the LAST_VALUE is calculated for each distinct `product_name`. Then, we order the rows by the `date` column. The `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` clause specifies that we want to consider all rows within the partition. Finally, in the `WHERE` clause, we specify the condition `quantity_sold > 100` to filter out rows where the quantity is not greater than 100.

The result of this query will provide the last value of `quantity_sold` for each product where the quantity is greater than 100.

# Conclusion

By combining the SQL LAST_VALUE function with logical operators, you can effectively filter and retrieve the last value based on specific conditions within your data. This allows for more precise and targeted result sets when working with ordered data.
