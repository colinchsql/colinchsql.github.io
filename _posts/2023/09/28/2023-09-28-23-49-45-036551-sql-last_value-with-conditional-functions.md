In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to retrieve the last value in an ordered set of data. It can also be combined with conditional functions to apply certain conditions when retrieving the last value. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `LAST_VALUE` function with conditional functions in SQL.

## Syntax of LAST_VALUE Function

The `LAST_VALUE` function is commonly used with the `OVER` clause in SQL. Here is the general syntax of the `LAST_VALUE` function:

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC])
```

The `expression` parameter represents the column or expression from which we want to retrieve the last value. The `PARTITION BY` clause allows us to divide the data into groups, while the `ORDER BY` clause specifies the order in which the data is evaluated.

## Using LAST_VALUE with SQL Conditional Functions

To apply conditional functions to the `LAST_VALUE`, we use a combination of `CASE` and `WHERE` clauses. Let's see a few examples:

### Example 1: Retrieve the last salary of male employees

```sql
SELECT
  employee_id,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY hire_date DESC) AS last_salary
FROM
  employees
WHERE
  gender = 'M'
```

In the above example, we use `LAST_VALUE` to retrieve the last salary of male employees. The `PARTITION BY gender` clause divides the data into groups based on gender, and the `ORDER BY hire_date DESC` clause orders the data by hire date in descending order. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to retrieve only male employees.

### Example 2: Retrieve the last product quantity sold for each category

```sql
SELECT
  category,
  product,
  quantity,
  LAST_VALUE(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS last_sold_quantity
FROM
  sales
```

In this example, we use `LAST_VALUE` to obtain the last product quantity sold for each category in the sales table. The `PARTITION BY category` clause groups the data by category, while the `ORDER BY order_date DESC` clause sorts the data by order date in descending order.

## Conclusion

The `LAST_VALUE` function in SQL allows us to retrieve the last value in an ordered set of data. When combined with conditional functions like `CASE` and `WHERE`, we can apply conditions to retrieve specific values based on different criteria. By using this powerful combination, we can efficiently perform data analysis and make informed decisions in SQL queries.
