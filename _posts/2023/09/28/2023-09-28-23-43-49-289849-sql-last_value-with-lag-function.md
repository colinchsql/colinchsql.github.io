In SQL, the `LAST_VALUE` function is used to return the last value within a group or window frame. It can be combined with the `LAG` function to retrieve the previous row's value.

The `LAG` function is used to get the value of a column from the previous row in the result set. By combining these two functions, we can access the last value of the previous row.

Here's an example of how to use `LAST_VALUE` with `LAG` function in SQL:

```sql
SELECT column_name, 
       LAG(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY order_column) AS previous_value,
       LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column) AS last_value
FROM table_name;
```

In the above example:
- `column_name` is the name of the column we want to retrieve values from.
- `order_column` is the column used to determine the order. It is used in both the `LAG` and `LAST_VALUE` functions.
- `partition_column` is an optional column used for partitioning the result set. It is only required if you want to retrieve the last value within each partition.

By using `LAG(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY order_column)`, we can retrieve the previous row's value in the result set. And by using `LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)`, we can retrieve the last value within each partition.

Note that the `LAG` function requires an `ORDER BY` clause to determine the order of rows. The `LAST_VALUE` function can use both `ORDER BY` and `PARTITION BY` clauses.

With the help of these functions, you can efficiently retrieve the previous row's value and the last value within a partition.
